<p>Half or more of the best new work in the last few years has been neither
painting nor sculpture. Usually it has been related, closely or distantly, to
one or the other. The work is diverse, and much in it that is not in painting
and sculpture is also diverse. But there are some things that occur nearly in
common.</p>

<p>The new three-dimensional work doesn't constitute a movement, school or
style.  The common aspects are too general and too little common to define a
movement.  The differences are greater than the similarities. The similarities
are selected from the work; they aren't a movement's first principles or
delimiting rules. Three-dimensionality is not as near being simply a container
as painting and sculpture have seemed to be, but it tends to that. But now
painting and sculpture are less neutral, less containers, more defined, not
undeniable and unavoidable. They are particular forms circumscribed after all,
producing fairly definite qualities. Much of the motivation in the new work is
to get clear of these forms. The use of three dimensions is an obvious
alternative. It opens to anything. Many of the reasons for this use are
negative, points against painting and sculpture, and since both are common
sources, the negative reasons are those nearest commonage. &ldquo;The motive to
change is always some uneasiness: nothing setting us upon the change of state,
or upon any new action, but some uneasiness.&rdquo; The positive reasons are
more particular. Another reason for listing the insufficiencies of painting and
sculpture first is that both are familiar and their elements and qualities more
easily located.</p>

<p>The objections to painting and sculpture are going to sound more intolerant
than they are. There are qualifications. The disinterest in painting and
sculpture is a disinterest in doing it again, not in it as it is being done by
those who developed the last advanced versions. New work always involves
objections to the old, but these objections are really relevant only to the
new. They are part of it. If the earlier work is first-rate it is complete. New
inconsistencies and limitations aren't retroactive; they concern only work that
is being developed. Obviously, three-dimensional work will not cleanly succeed
painting and sculpture. It's not like a movement; anyway, movements no longer
work; also, linear history has unraveled somewhat. The new work exceeds
painting in plain power, but power isn't the only consideration, though the
difference between it and expression can't be too great either. There are other
ways than power and form in which one kind of art can be more or less than
another. Finally, a flat and rectangular surface is too handy to give up. Some
things can be done only on a flat surface. Lichtenstein's representation of a
representation is a good instance. But this work which is neither painting nor
sculpture challenges both. It will have to be taken into account by new
artists. It will probably change painting and sculpture.</p>

<p>The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed
flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself; it is obviously the whole
shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or inside of
it. In work before 1946 the edges of the rectangle are a boundary, the end of
the picture. The composition must react to the edges and the rectangle must be
unified, but the shape of the rectangle is not stressed; the parts are more
important, and the relationships of color and form occur among them. In the
paintings of Pollock, Rothko, Still and Newman, and more recently of Reinhardt
and Noland, the rectangle is emphasized. The elements inside the rectangle are
broad and simple and correspond closely to the rectangle. The shapes and
surface are only those which can occur plausibly within and on a rectangular
plane. The parts are few and so subordinate to the unity as not to be parts in
an ordinary sense. A painting is nearly an entity, one thing, and not the
indefinable sum of a group of entities and references. The one thing overpowers
the earlier painting. It also establishes the rectangle as a definite form; it
is no longer a fairly neutral limit. A form can be used only in so many ways.
The rectangular plane is given a life span. The simplicity required to
emphasize the rectangle limits the arrangements possible within it. The sense
of singleness also has a duration, but it is only beginning and has a better
future outside of painting. Its occurrence in painting now looks like a
beginning, in which new forms are often made from earlier schemes and
materials.</p>

<p>The plane is also emphasized and nearly single. It is clearly a plane one or
two inches in front of another plane, the wall, and parallel to it. The
relationship of the two planes is specific; it is a form. Everything on or
slightly in the plane of the painting must be arranged laterally.</p>

<p>Almost all paintings are spatial in one way or another. Yves Klein's blue
paintings are the only ones that are unspatial, and there is little that is
nearly unspatial, mainly Stella's work. It's possible that not much can be done
with both an upright rectangular plane and an absence of space. Anything on a
surface has space behind it. Two colors on the same surface almost always lie
on different depths. An even color, especially in oil paint, covering all or
much of a painting is almost always both flat and infinitely spatial. The space
is shallow in all of the work in which the rectangular plane is stressed.
Rothko's space is shallow and the soft rectangles are parallel to the plane,
but the space is almost traditionally illusionistic. In Reinhardt's paintings,
just back from the plane of the canvas, there is a flat plane and this seems in
turn indefinitely deep. Pollock's paint is obviously on the canvas, and the
space is mainly that made by any marks on a surface, so that it is not very
descriptive and illusionistic. Noland's concentric bands are not as
specifically paint-on-a-surface as Pollock's paint, but the bands flatten the
literal space more. As flat and unillusionistic as Noland's paintings are, the
bands do advance and recede. Even a single circle will warp the surface to it,
will have a little space behind it.</p>

<p>Except for a complete and unvaried field of color or marks, anything spaced
in a rectangle and on a plane suggests something in and on something else,
something in its surround, which suggests an object or figure in its space, in
which these are clearer instances of a similar world&mdash;that's the main
purpose of painting. The recent paintings aren't completely single. There are a
few dominant areas, Rothko's rectangles or Noland's circles, and there is the
area around them. There is a gap between the main forms, the most expressive
parts, and the rest of the canvas, the plane and the rectangle. The central
forms still occur in a wider and indefinite context, although the singleness of
the paintings abridges the general and solipsistic quality of earlier work.
Fields are also usually not limited, and they give the appearance of sections
cut from something indefinitely larger.</p>

<p>Oil paint and canvas aren't as strong as commercial paints and as the colors
and surfaces of materials, especially if the materials are used in three
dimensions. Oil and canvas are familiar and, like the rectangular plane, have a
certain quality and have limits. The quality is especially identified with art.</p>

<p>The new work obviously resembles sculpture more than it does painting, but
it is nearer to painting. Most sculpture is like the painting which preceded
Pollock, Rothko, Still and Newman. The newest thing about it is its broad
scale. Its materials are somewhat more emphasized than before. The imagery
involves a couple of salient resemblances to other visible things and a number
of more oblique references, everything generalized to compatibility. The parts
and the space are allusive, descriptive and somewhat naturalistic. Higgins'
sculpture is an example, and, dissimilary, Di Suvero's. Higgins' sculpture
mainly suggests machines and truncated bodies. Its combination of plaster and
metal is more specific. Di Suvero uses beams as if they were brush strokes,
imitating movement, as Kline did. The material never has its own movement. A
beam thrusts, a piece of iron follows a gesture; together they form a
naturalistic and anthropomorphic image. The space corresponds.</p>

<p>Most sculpture is made part by part, by addition, composed. The main parts
remain fairly discrete. They and the small parts are a collection of
variations, slight through great. There are hierarchies of clarity and strength
and of proximity to one or two main ideas. Wood and metal are the usual
materials, either alone or together, and if together it is without much of a
contrast. There is seldom any color. The middling contrast and the natural
monochrome are general and help to unify the parts.</p>

<p>There is little of any of this in the new three-dimensional work. So far the
most obvious difference within this diverse work is between that which is
something of an object, a single thing, and that which is open and extended,
more or less environmental. There isn't as great a difference in their nature
as in their appearance, though. Oldenburg and others have done both. There are
precedents for some of the characteristics of the new work. The parts are
usually subordinate and not separate as in Arp's sculpture and often in
Brancusi's. Duchamp's ready-mades and other Dada objects are also seen at once
and not part by part. Cornell's boxes have too many parts to seem at first to
be structured.</p>

<p>Part-by-part structure can't be too simple or too complicated. It has to seem
orderly. The degree of Arp's abstraction, the moderate extent of his reference
to the human body, neither imitative nor very oblique, is unlike the imagery of
most of the new three- dimensional work. Duchamp's bottle-drying rack is close
to some of it. The work of Johns and Rauschenberg and assemblage and low-relief
generally, Ortman's reliefs for example, are preliminaries. Johns's few cast
objects and a few of Rauschenberg's works, such as the goat with the tire, are
beginnings.</p>

<p>Some European paintings are related to objects, Klein's for instance, and
Castellani's, which have unvaried fields of low-relief elements. Arman and a
few others work in three dimensions. Dick Smith did some large pieces in London
with canvas stretched over cockeyed parallelepiped frames and with the surfaces
painted as if the pieces were paintings. Philip King, also in London, seems to
be making objects. Some of the work on the West Coast seems to be along this
line, that of Larry Bell, Kenneth Price, Tony Delap, Sven Lukin, Bruce Conner,
Kienholz of course, and others. Some of the work in New York having some or
most of the characteristics is that by George Brecht, Ronald Bladen, John
Willenbecher, Ralph Ortiz, Anne Truitt, Paul Harris, Barry McDowell, John
Chamberlain, Robert Tanner, Aaron Kuriloff, Robert Morris, Nathan Raisen, Tony
Smith, Richard Navin, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Watts, Yoshimura, John Anderson,
Harry Soviak, Yayoi Kusama, Frank Stella, Salvatore Scarpitta, Neil Williams,
George Segal, Michael Snow, Richard Artschwager, Arakawa, Lucas Samaras, Lee
Bontecou, Dan Flavin and Robert Whitman. H. C. Westermann works in Connecticut.
Some of these artists do both three-dimensional work and paintings. A small
amount of the work of others, Warhol and Rosenquist for instance, is
three-dimensional.</p>

<p>The composition and imagery of Chamberlain's work is primarily the same as that
of earlier painting, but these are secondary to an appearance of disorder and
are at first concealed by the material. The crumpled tin tends to stay that
way. It is neutral at first, not artistic, and later seems objective. When the
structure and imagery become apparent, there seems to be too much tin and
space, more chance and casualness than order. The aspects of neutrality,
redundancy and form and imagery could not be coextensive without three
dimensions and without the particular material. The color is also both natural
and sensitive and, unlike oil colors, has a wide range. Most color that is
integral, other than in painting, has been used in three-dimensional work.
Color is never unimportant, as it usually is in sculpture.</p>

<p>Stella's shaped paintings involve several important characteristics of
three-dimensional work. The periphery of a piece and the lines inside
correspond. The stripes are nowhere near being discrete parts. The surface is
farther from the wall than usual, though it remains parallel to it. Since the
surface is exceptionally unified and involves little or no space, the parallel
plane is unusually distinct. The order is not rationalistic and underlying but
is simply order, like that of continuity, one thing after another. A painting
isn't an image. The shapes, the unity, projection, order and color are
specific, aggressive and powerful.</p>

<p>Painting and sculpture have become set forms. A fair amount of their meaning
isn't credible. The use of three dimensions isn't the use of a given form.
There hasn't been enough time and work to see limits. So far, considered most
widely, three dimensions are mostly a space to move into. The characteristics
of three dimensions are those of only a small amount of work, little compared
to painting and sculpture. A few of the more general aspects may persist, such
as the work's being like an object or being specific, but other characteristics
are bound to develop. Since its range is so wide, three-dimensional work will
probably divide into a number of forms. At any rate, it will be larger than
painting and much larger than sculpture, which, compared to painting, is fairly
particular, much nearer to what is usually called a form, having a certain kind
of form. Because the nature of three dimensions isn't set, given beforehand,
something credible can be made, almost anything. Of course something can be
done within a given form, such as painting, but with some narrowness and less
strength and variation. Since sculpture isn't so general a form, it can
probably be only what it is now-which means that if it changes a great deal it
will be something else; so it is finished.</p>

<p>Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism
and of literal space, space in and around marks and colors - which is riddance
of one of the salient and most objectionable relics of European art. The
several limits of painting are no longer present. A work can be as powerful as
it can be thought to be. Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and
specific than paint on a flat surface. Obviously, anything in three dimensions
can be any shape, regular or irregular, and can have any relation to the wall,
floor, ceiling, room, rooms or exterior or none at all. Any material can be
used, as is or painted.</p>

<p>A work needs only to be interesting. Most works finally have one quality. In
earlier art the complexity was displayed and built the quality. In recent
painting the complexity was in the format and the few main shapes, which had
been made according to various interests and problems. A painting by Newman is
finally no simpler than one by Cezanne. In the three-dimensional work the whole
thing is made according to complex purposes, and these are not scattered but
asserted by one form. It isn't necessary for a work to have a lot of things to
look at, to compare, to analyze one by one, to contemplate. The thing as a
whole, its quality as a whole, is what is interesting. The main things are
alone and are more intense, clear and powerful. They are not diluted by an
inherited format, variations of a form, mild contrasts and connecting parts and
areas. European art had to represent a space and its contents as well as have
sufficient unity and aesthetic interest. Abstract painting before 1946 and most
subsequent painting kept the representational subordination of the whole to its
parts. Sculpture still does. In the new work the shape, image, color and
surface are single and not partial and scattered. There aren't any neutral or
moderate areas or parts, any connections or transitional areas. The difference
between the new work and earlier painting and present sculpture is like that
between one of Brunelleschi's windows in the Badia di Fiesole and the fa&ccedil;ade of
the Palazzo Rucellai, which is only an undeveloped rectangle as a whole and is
mainly a collection of highly ordered parts.</p>

<p>The use of three dimensions makes it possible to use all sorts of materials
and colors. Most of the work involves new materials, either recent inventions
or things not used before in art. Little was done until lately with the wide
range of industrial products. Almost nothing has been done with industrial
techniques and, because of the cost, probably won't be for some time. Art could
be mass-produced, and possibilities otherwise unavailable, such as stamping,
could be used. Dan Flavin, who uses fluorescent lights, has appropriated the
results of industrial production. Materials vary greatly and are simply
materials&mdash;formica, aluminum, cold-rolled steel, plexiglas, red and common
brass, and so forth. They are specific. If they are used directly, they are
more specific. Also, they are usually aggressive. There is an objectivity to
the obdurate identity of a material. Also, of course, the qualities of
materials&mdash;hard mass, soft mass, thickness of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub>,
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch, pliability,
slickness, translucency, dullness&mdash;have unobjective uses. The vinyl of
Oldenburg's soft objects looks the same as ever, slick, flaccid and a little
disagreeable, and is objective, but it is pliable and can be sewn and stuffed
with air and kapok and hung or set down, sagging or collapsing. Most of the new
materials are not as accessible as oil on canvas and are hard to relate to one
another. They aren't obviously art. The form of a work and its materials are
closely related. In earlier work the structure and the imagery were executed in
some neutral and homogeneous material. Since not many things are lumps, there
are problems in combining the different surfaces and colors and in relating the parts so as not to weaken the</p>

<p>Three-dimensional work usually doesn't involve ordinary anthropomorphic
imagery. If there is a reference it is single and explicit. In any case the
chief interests are obvious. Each of Bontecou's reliefs is an image. The image,
all of the parts and the whole shape are coextensive. The parts are either part
of the hole or part of the mound which forms the hole. The hole and the mound
are only two things, which, after all, are the same thing. The parts and
divisions are either radial or concentric in regard to the hole, leading in and
out and enclosing. The radial and concentric parts meet more or less at right
angles and in detail are structure in the old sense, but collectively are
subordinate to the single form.</p>

<p>Most of the new work has no structure in the usual sense, especially the work
of Oldenburg and Stella. Chamberlain's work does involve composition. The
nature of Bontecou's single image is not so different from that of images which
occurred in a small way in semiabstract painting. The image is primarily a
single emotive one, which alone wouldn't resemble the old imagery so much, but
to which internal and external references, such as violence and war, have been
added. The additions are somewhat pictorial, but the image is essentially new
and surprising; an image has never before been the whole work, been so large,
been so explicit and aggressive. The abatised orifice is like a strange and
dangerous object. The quality is intense and narrow and obsessive. The boat and
the furniture that Kusama covered with white protuberances have a related
intensity and obsessiveness and are also strange objects. Kusama is interested
in obsessive repetition, which is a single interest. Yves Klein's blue
paintings are also narrow and intense.</p>

<p>The trees, figures, food or furniture in a painting have a shape or contain
shapes that are emotive. Oldenburg has taken this anthropomorphism to an
extreme and made the emotive form, with him basic and biopsychological, the
same as the shape of an object, and by blatancy subverted the idea of the
natural presence of human qualities in all things. And further, Oldenburg
avoids trees and people. All of Oldenburg's grossly anthropomorphized objects
are manmade - which right away is an empirical matter. Someone or many made
these things and incorporated their preferences. As practical as an ice-cream
cone is, a lot of people made a choice, and more agreed, as to its appearance
and existence. This interest shows more in the recent appliances and fixtures
from the home and especially in the bedroom suite, where the choice is
flagrant. Oldenburg exaggerates the accepted or chosen form and turns it into
one of his own.</p>

<p>Nothing made is completely objective, purely practical or merely present.
Oldenburg gets along very well without anything that would ordinarily be called
structure. The ball and cone of the large ice-cream cone are enough. The whole
thing is a profound form, such as sometimes occurs in primitive art. Three fat
layers with a small one on top are enough. So is a flaccid, flamingo switch
draped from two points. Simple form and one or two colors are considered less
by old standards. If changes in art are compared backwards, there always seems
to be a reduction, since only old attributes are counted and these are always
fewer. But obviously new things are more, such as Oldenburg's techniques and
materials. Oldenburg needs three dimensions in order to simulate and enlarge a
real object and to equate it and an emotive form. If a hamburger were painted
it would retain something of the traditional anthropomorphism. George Brecht
and Robert Morris use real objects and depend on the viewer's knowledge of
these objects.</p>
