        <h2>Christian Minimalism</h2>

        <div id="byline">By <a href="http://www.whit537.org/">Chad
                Whitacre</a></div>

        <p>Christian Minimalism is a theological movement. It intends to be
        continuous with the mainstream current of Christianity through the
        ages, and simultaneously to appreciate the beauty of God's work in the
        life of every person, Christian or not. It is minimalist in that it
        addresses the interpersonal level only, entrusting structural-level
        definitions to other entities. Its goal is to encourage the human
        family towards Godliness.</p>

        <p>The thrust of Christian Minimalism is Love, <i>agape</i>, at the
        interpersonal level. Using <a href="http://bible.xmin.org">the
            Bible</a> as our first source, the external focus out of which
        culture properly radiates (and all of culture is available, on the
        table; there are no taboos, that age is over), we attempt to capture in
        words what we all know in our hearts.  Our hearts are the internal
        focus complementing the external.</p>

        <p>Christian Minimalism is a subset of systematic theology based on the
        individual human person. It is a thoroughly individualistic account of
        Christianity. At first blush, this seems at odds with the Christian
        mainstream, which rejects individualism. Christian Minimalism's gambit
        is that, scripturally and from general experience, the case can be made
        for a system, recognizably Christian, built upon the atomic
        individual.</p>

        <p>So the Christian Minimalist atom is the person, the atomic free
        will. Free enough for our purposes, mind you, not for God's. We need
        not defend a concept of free will absolute enough to satisfy the human
        demands of divine judgement. It is enough that our experience of will
        be free&mdash;that of our own and of that of others. The thesis I wish
        to defend is that the moral choice of the individual is absolute. In
        the final analysis, the pronouncement of the Pope carries no more
        weight <i>at the interpersonal level</i> than that of the pauper. The
        Pope, <i>qua</i> Pope (that is, as the Pope, rather than Joseph
        Ratzinger, mortal man) is a person playing a role in a system. Joseph
        Ratzinger lying awake in his bed at night is a man, red-blooded. Pope
        Benedict is something else. Joseph Stalin</a> understood this when he
    <a
        href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/05/05/stalin/print.html">said
        to his son</a>, "You're not Stalin and I'm not Stalin. Stalin is Soviet
    power. Stalin is what he is in the newspapers and the portraits, not you,
    no not even me!"</p>

        <p>The work remains to be done (my intention is to build <a
            href="http://bible.xmin.org">The XMin Bible</a> in order to do the
        necessary research), but my preliminary thesis is that Jesus addresses
        most directly the interpersonal level. He is talking to villagers,
        provincial bumpkins, telling them how to relate to their neighors, as
        in, the people they can spit at and hit. Jesus addresses the structural
        level only indirectly, I suggest.</p>

        <p>And that, dear friends, is a start.</p>
