        <h2>Christian Minimalism</h2>

        <div id="byline">By <a href="http://www.whit537.org/">Chad
                Whitacre</a></div>

        <p>Christian Minimalism is a theological experiment. To what extent can
        catholic Christianity be reconstituted on the basis of the atomic
        individual? From experience and culture, we get the idea that the
        individual is absolute, inviolable. The individual can be crushed, but
        never broken. The individual is the only truly indivisible unit,
        culturally speaking. The individual is the building block of
        culture.</p>
        
        <p>We also get the idea that the individual is the
        fundamental unit of divine communication. Every prophecy begins as an
        impression on the screen of consciousness. Only with the passage of
        time and the playing out of these ideas over millenia do they assume
        the mantle of prophecy, of divine communication. This process is as yet
        underway.</p>

        <p>There are veins of these ideas in the Bible:</p>
       
        <ul>

            <li>Adam being made in the "image of God" is parallel to Seth being
            made in the "image of Adam:" a child, a peer-in-waiting. Compare
            the genealogy in Luke, where God is the <i>pater familias</i>.</li>

            <li>Abraham bargains with God.</li>

            <li>Jacob wrestles God to a draw.</li>

            <li>Jeremiah foretells the day when each individual will know God
            equally.</li>

            <li>The Canaanite Woman rises to Christ's challenge to beat him
            at his own game.</li>

            <li>Peter invites us to become "partakers of the divine
            nature."</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Christian Minimalism asks the question, can catholic Christianity be
        built atop the absolute individual? I take catholic Christianity to be
        more or less the definition of Rome, with some allowance for Orthodox,
        Anglican, Protestant, and Anabaptist distinctives. What becomes of
        these systems when one begins with the individual person as
        absolute?</p>

        <p>I see several tasks:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Define the individual as atom from cultural sources.</li>

            <li>Draw out the individualist vein in <a
                href="http://bible.xmin.org/">the Bible</a>. Attempt to make
            the case that the trajectory of scripture and history is towards
            the atomic individual.</li>
           
            <li>Define the group on the basis of the atomic individual.</li>

            <li>Give an account of the possibility of divine
            communication.</li>

            <li>Define and evaluate specifically the catholic system on the
            basis of the atomic individual.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>What, we ask, does Christianity mean in an age of individualism?</p>
