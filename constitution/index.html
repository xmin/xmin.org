<h1><span style="font-size: 67%;">The Constitution of</span><br />
    Christian Minimalism</h1>

<div id="logo"><img src="xmin.png" alt="Christian Minimalism (XMin)" /></div>

<div id="nav">
    <a href="#preamble">Preamble</a> | 
    <a href="#mission">Mission</a> | 
    <a href="#structure">Structure</a> | 
    <a href="#rule">Rule of Life</a> | 
    <a href="#liturgy">Liturgy</a>
</div>


<a name="preamble"></a>
<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>True religion is a matter of the heart, and the force of true religion
dissipates as it is held by larger and larger entities. Christian Minimalism
(XMin) is a denomination of the Christian religion that is minimally defined at
the global level. XMin is not incorporated legally. It holds no property, has
no clergy, and conducts no ecumenical relations. The household is the largest
constituent entity that it recognizes, and it has no official records of
membership. XMin defines no explicit doctrine; its official teaching is
comprised entirely of this Constitution.</p>


<a name="mission"></a>
<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>The mission of Christian Minimalism is to convert the world to the Gospel of
Jesus Christ.</p>


<a name="structure"></a>
<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Christian Minimalism is organized as a voluntary association of individuals
and households. An XMin <b>individual</b> or <b>adherent</b> of XMin is <i>an
    adult who has been baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the
    Holy Spirit, and is committed to Christian Minimalism as defined in this
    Constitution</i>. An XMin <b>household</b> is either <i>a family in which
    both husband and wife are adherents of XMin</i>, or <i>two or more XMin
    individuals (celibate and of the same gender) who live together as an XMin
    household</i>. A <b>family</b> is <i>a husband and wife and their dependent
    children</i>. XMin individuals who do not live in a household, including
single parents and those married to a non-adherent of XMin, maintain a special
relationship of affiliation with exactly one XMin household.</p>

<p>This Constitution is published on the World Wide Web at http://xmin.org/.
Such minimal governance as XMin requires for the maintenance and publication of
this Constitution is carried out via the Internet by a group of XMin
individuals. Membership in this group is voluntary, self-selecting, and open to
all adherents of XMin. All of the group's business is conducted transparently,
in full public view. This Constitution is dedicated to the public domain.</p>


<a name="rule"></a>
<h2>Rule of Life</h2>

<p>All adherents of XMin make four commitments, to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Worship</li>
    <li>Faithfulness</li>
    <li>Problem Solving</li>
    <li>Conversion</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Worship</h3>

<p>Worship is an act of corporate intimacy with God. It capitulates the general
fellowship with God that is available to all people at all times. XMin
prescribes <a href="#liturgy">a simple liturgy</a> to be used by its
adherents.</p>


<h3>2. Faithfulness</h3>

<p>Adherents of XMin remain faithful to household, neighborhood, work, and
other relationships. Relationships grow with time spent together, and time
spent together in the real world is more valuable than time spent communicating
otherwise.</p>


<h3>3. Problem Solving</h3>

<p>Problem solving in XMin is an approach to daily life. In solving problems
from the personal to the international, adherents of XMin emphasize creativity,
collaboration, optimism, non-violence, and a lack of judgmentalism.</p>


<h3>4. Conversion</h3>

<p>Adherents of XMin are responsible first for their own conversion and that of
their household. The practices of Faithfulness and Problem Solving involve XMin
individuals in their neighborhoods and workplaces, and in the world at large.
As relationships allow, XMin households invite other families and individuals
to participate in their practice of Worship, and in time perhaps to become
adherents of XMin themselves.</p>


<a name="liturgy"></a>
<h2>Liturgy</h2>

<p>The XMin liturgy has three services: Communion, Baptism, and Marriage. All
passages of Scripture used in the liturgy are adapted from the <a
    href="http://www.ebible.org/">World English Bible</a>. Service sheets for
each liturgy are linked below, and are considered part of this Constitution.</p>

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<p>XMin observes a liturgical calendar, with seasons as follows:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Season</th>
        <th>First Day, per Gregorian Calendar</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Advent</td>
        <td>the fourth Sunday before Christmas</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Christmas</td>
        <td>December 25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Epiphany</td>
        <td>January 6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Lent</td>
        <td>the 46th day before Easter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Easter</td>
        <td>Y = Gregorian calendar year<br />
            a = Y mod 19<br />
            b = floor (Y / 100)<br />
            c = Y mod 100<br />
            d = floor (b / 4)<br />
            e = b mod 4<br />
            f = floor ((b + 8) / 25)<br />
            g = floor ((b - f + 1) / 3)<br />
            h = (19a + b - d - g + 15) mod 30<br />
            i = floor (c / 4)<br />
            k = c mod 4<br />
            L = (32 + 2e + 2i - h - k)<br />
            m = floor ((a + 11h + 22L) / 451)<br />
            <b>month</b> = floor ((h + L - 7m + 114) / 31)<br />
            <b>day</b> = ((h + L - 7m + 114) mod 31) + 1<br />
            <br />
            (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus#Anonymous_algorithm">source</a>)<br /><br />
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="col1">Pentecost</td>
        <td>the 49th day after Easter</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h3>Communion</h3>

<p>On Sunday, the household gathers together with any guests to celebrate
Communion. Before the service, good wine and good unleavened bread are set out,
along with any service sheets.</p>

<p>The recitations from Scripture, the Apostles' Creed, and the Lord's Prayer
are read by all together. All are encouraged to share matters for prayer, and
offer the same during the time of open prayer. After the second recitation, the
bread and wine are passed around the room in silence. Each XMin adherent eats a
bite of the bread and drinks a sip of the wine. Children aged 16 years or
younger also receive, with their parents' permission. The service concludes
with a minute or two of further silence.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to accompany this service of Communion with a meal,
music-making, Bible study, or other forms of fellowship.</p>
