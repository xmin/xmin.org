    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> You have three practices... but what about
    ``believe''?  That seems to me to be an essential, minimalist if you will,
    part of what Jesus was calling people to do.</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> How would you phrase that in three words? Believe
    in Jesus? in God? Believe the Creeds? Creed?</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> I like John 6:29 - it's not in three words
    though - Jesus answered, ``The work of God is this: to believe in the one
    he has sent.''</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> In context this means giving allegiance to Jesus,
    which I think I've essentially done, having committed to ``read the
    Gospels,'' and ``love one another.'' No?</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> I don't know, I think you can read the gospels
    without believing them, and certainly people love one another without doing
    it in the name of Jesus. I think Jesus is asking for the trust of our
    hearts which maybe is sufficiently captured in your three practices, I just
    thought it was worth asking the question.</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> I guess faith ultimately can't be *captured* by a
    set of practices, these or any other.</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> valiant effort, though. :) Or was that not what
    you were trying to do?</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> Naw, just trying to build a nice cozy cottage for
    myself.  Cathedrals are nice but they cost a fortune to heat. :)</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> Don't get too cozy - sometimes God calls us to a
    cave or a hole in the ground (Hebrews 11:38). But I guess since you're only
    reading the Gospels, you don't have to worry about that verse. :)</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> Who said I'm only reading the Gospels?</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> I thought you did!</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> Okay, I just went back and read your description
    - you didn't say that. But why pick the Gospels out as more special than
    the rest of Scripture? (Feel free to start ignoring me if this conversation
    is driving you crazy - I'm actually about to leave the house and won't be
    around to keep going back and forth. But it's been fun.)</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> The Gospels show us Jesus. Isn't that special?
    (And, I am enjoying this conversation too. Thank you for it! :-D )</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> I'm home - Jesus himself used the whole of
    Scriptures (which did not at the time include the Gospels, of course) to
    reveal HIMSELF to the folks on the Emmaus road - He's in Isaiah, and
    Hebrews, and Revelation, and just about any book you care to look for
    Him...</p>

    <p><i>Chad Whitacre:</i> I find him clearest in the Gospels (is that
    controversial?). So XMin says: I'll start with the Gospels, and work
    outwards from there to read any book I care to. The Gospels will inform my
    reading of Isaiah *and* Danielle Steel.</p>

    <p><i>Sarah Sanderson:</i> fair enough.</p>
