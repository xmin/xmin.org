    <h2>Matthew</h2>

<p><span class="verse">{1:1}</span> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of
David, the son of Abraham. <span class="verse">{1:2}</span> Abraham became the father of Isaac.
Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of Judah and
his brothers. <span class="verse">{1:3}</span> Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by
Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the father of
Ram. <span class="verse">{1:4}</span> Ram became the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the
father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of Salmon. <span class="verse">{1:5}</span> Salmon
became the father of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by
Ruth. Obed became the father of Jesse. <span class="verse">{1:6}</span> Jesse became the father of
King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had been the
wife of Uriah. <span class="verse">{1:7}</span> Solomon became the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam
became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father of Asa. <span class="verse">{1:8}</span> Asa
became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of
Joram. Joram became the father of Uzziah. <span class="verse">{1:9}</span> Uzziah became the
father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the
father of Hezekiah. <span class="verse">{1:10}</span> Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh.
Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah.
<span class="verse">{1:11}</span> Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the
time of the exile to Babylon. <span class="verse">{1:12}</span> After the exile to Babylon,
Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father
of Zerubbabel. <span class="verse">{1:13}</span> Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud
became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the father of Azor. <span class="verse">{1:14}</span>
Azor became the father of Sadoc. Sadoc became the father of Achim.
Achim became the father of Eliud. <span class="verse">{1:15}</span> Eliud became the father of
Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the
father of Jacob. <span class="verse">{1:16}</span> Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband
of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. <span class="verse">{1:17}</span>
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations;
from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the
carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:18}</span> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his
mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse">{1:19}</span> Joseph, her husband, being a
righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended
to put her away secretly. <span class="verse">{1:20}</span> But when he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take to yourself
Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Spirit. <span class="verse">{1:21}</span> She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name
Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:22}</span> Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
<span class="verse">{1:23}</span> "Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
   and shall bring forth a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel";
   which is, being interpreted, "God with us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:24}</span> Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him, and took his wife to himself; <span class="verse">{1:25}</span> and didn't know her
sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him
Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:1}</span> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
saying, <span class="verse">{2:2}</span> "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his
star in the east, and have come to worship him." <span class="verse">{2:3}</span> When King Herod
heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <span class="verse">{2:4}</span> Gathering
together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them
where the Christ would be born. <span class="verse">{2:5}</span> They said to him, "In Bethlehem
of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,
<span class="verse">{2:6}</span> 'You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
   are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
for out of you shall come forth a governor,
   who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:7}</span> Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them
exactly what time the star appeared. <span class="verse">{2:8}</span> He sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have
found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:9}</span> They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the
star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and
stood over where the young child was. <span class="verse">{2:10}</span> When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <span class="verse">{2:11}</span> They came into the
house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down
and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts:
gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <span class="verse">{2:12}</span> Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another
way.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:13}</span> Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,
for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:14}</span> He arose and took the young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt, <span class="verse">{2:15}</span> and was there until the death of Herod;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:16}</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children
who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two
years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned
from the wise men. <span class="verse">{2:17}</span> Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<span class="verse">{2:18}</span> "A voice was heard in Ramah,
   lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children;
   she wouldn't be comforted,
   because they are no more."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:19}</span> But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, <span class="verse">{2:20}</span> "Arise and take
the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for
those who sought the young child's life are dead."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:21}</span> He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came
into the land of Israel. <span class="verse">{2:22}</span> But when he heard that Archelaus was
reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to
go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee, <span class="verse">{2:23}</span> and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He will be
called a Nazarene."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:1}</span> In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, saying, <span class="verse">{3:2}</span> "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand!" <span class="verse">{3:3}</span> For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the
prophet, saying,
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
   make ready the way of the Lord.
   Make his paths straight."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:4}</span> Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a
leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
<span class="verse">{3:5}</span> Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region
around the Jordan went out to him. <span class="verse">{3:6}</span> They were baptized by
him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. <span class="verse">{3:7}</span> But when he saw many of
the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said
to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
wrath to come? <span class="verse">{3:8}</span> Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
<span class="verse">{3:9}</span> Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for
I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these
stones.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:10}</span> "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore
every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast
into the fire. <span class="verse">{3:11}</span> I indeed baptize you in water for
repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I
am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
<span class="verse">{3:12}</span> His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly
cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn,
but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:13}</span> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
baptized by him. <span class="verse">{3:14}</span> But John would have hindered him, saying, "I
need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:15}</span> But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is
the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed
him. <span class="verse">{3:16}</span> Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the
water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of
God descending as a dove, and coming on him. <span class="verse">{3:17}</span> Behold, a voice out
of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:1}</span> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil. <span class="verse">{4:2}</span> When he had fasted forty days and forty
nights, he was hungry afterward. <span class="verse">{4:3}</span> The tempter came and said to
him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become
bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:4}</span> But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:5}</span> Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the
pinnacle of the temple, <span class="verse">{4:6}</span> and said to him, "If you are the Son of
God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in
charge of you.' and,
'On their hands they will bear you up,
   so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:7}</span> Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test
the Lord, your God.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:8}</span> Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and
showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. <span class="verse">{4:9}</span> He
said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall
down and worship me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:10}</span> Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For
it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall
serve him only.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:11}</span> Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served
him. <span class="verse">{4:12}</span> Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he
withdrew into Galilee. <span class="verse">{4:13}</span> Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in
Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
<span class="verse">{4:14}</span> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the
prophet, saying,
<span class="verse">{4:15}</span> "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
   toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
   Galilee of the Gentiles,
<span class="verse">{4:16}</span> the people who sat in darkness saw a great light,
   to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
   to them light has dawned."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:17}</span> From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent!
For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:18}</span> Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers:
Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into
the sea; for they were fishermen. <span class="verse">{4:19}</span> He said to them, "Come after
me, and I will make you fishers for men."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:20}</span> They immediately left their nets and followed him. <span class="verse">{4:21}</span>
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father,
mending their nets. He called them. <span class="verse">{4:22}</span> They immediately left the
boat and their father, and followed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:23}</span> Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every
disease and every sickness among the people. <span class="verse">{4:24}</span> The report about
him went out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick,
afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons,
epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them. <span class="verse">{4:25}</span> Great multitudes
from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan
followed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:1}</span> Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he
had sat down, his disciples came to him. <span class="verse">{5:2}</span> He opened his mouth and
taught them, saying,</p>

<p>
<span class="verse">{5:3}</span> "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
   for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
<span class="verse">{5:4}</span> Blessed are those who mourn,
   for they shall be comforted.
<span class="verse">{5:5}</span> Blessed are the gentle,
   for they shall inherit the earth.
<span class="verse">{5:6}</span> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
   for they shall be filled.
<span class="verse">{5:7}</span> Blessed are the merciful,
   for they shall obtain mercy.
<span class="verse">{5:8}</span> Blessed are the pure in heart,
   for they shall see God.
<span class="verse">{5:9}</span> Blessed are the peacemakers,
   for they shall be called children of God.
<span class="verse">{5:10}</span> Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness'
      sake,
   for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:11}</span> "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and
say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. <span class="verse">{5:12}</span> Rejoice,
and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that
is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:13}</span> "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its
flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but
to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. <span class="verse">{5:14}</span> You are the
light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden. <span class="verse">{5:15}</span>
Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but
on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. <span class="verse">{5:16}</span> Even so,
let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father who is in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:17}</span> "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets.
I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill. <span class="verse">{5:18}</span> For most certainly, I
tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest
letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away
from the law, until all things are accomplished. <span class="verse">{5:19}</span> Whoever,
therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach
others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but
whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of
Heaven. <span class="verse">{5:20}</span> For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds
that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:21}</span> "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You
shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of
the judgment.' <span class="verse">{5:22}</span> But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with
his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the
judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'Raca!' shall
be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall
be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.</p>

<p> <span class="verse">{5:23}</span> "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and
there remember that your brother has anything against you, <span class="verse">{5:24}</span> leave
your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled
to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. <span class="verse">{5:25}</span> Agree with
your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps
the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to
the officer, and you be cast into prison. <span class="verse">{5:26}</span> Most certainly I tell
you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the
last penny.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:27}</span> "You have heard that it was said,  'You shall not commit
adultery;' <span class="verse">{5:28}</span> but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman
to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
<span class="verse">{5:29}</span> If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw
it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your
members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into
Gehenna. <span class="verse">{5:30}</span> If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut
it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you
that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be
cast into Gehenna.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:31}</span> "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of divorce,' <span class="verse">{5:32}</span> but I tell you that whoever
puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes
her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits
adultery.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:33}</span> "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time,
'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your
vows,' <span class="verse">{5:34}</span> but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven,
for it is the throne of God; <span class="verse">{5:35}</span> nor by the earth, for it is the
footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
great King. <span class="verse">{5:36}</span> Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't
make one hair white or black. <span class="verse">{5:37}</span> But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and
your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:38}</span> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth.' <span class="verse">{5:39}</span> But I tell you, don't resist him who is
evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the
other also. <span class="verse">{5:40}</span> If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him
have your cloak also. <span class="verse">{5:41}</span> Whoever compels you to go one mile, go
with him two. <span class="verse">{5:42}</span> Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him
who desires to borrow from you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:43}</span> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your
neighbor, and hate your enemy.' <span class="verse">{5:44}</span> But I tell you, love
your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you,
and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you, <span class="verse">{5:45}</span> that you
may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun
to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the
unjust. <span class="verse">{5:46}</span> For if you love those who love you, what reward do you
have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same? <span class="verse">{5:47}</span> If you only
greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the
tax collectors do the same? <span class="verse">{5:48}</span> Therefore you shall be
perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:1}</span> "Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before
men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father
who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{6:2}</span> Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't
sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues
and in the streets, that they may get glory from men. Most certainly I
tell you, they have received their reward. <span class="verse">{6:3}</span> But when you do
merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand
does, <span class="verse">{6:4}</span> so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your
Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:5}</span> "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they
love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the
streets, that they may be seen by men. Most certainly, I tell you, they
have received their reward. <span class="verse">{6:6}</span> But you, when you pray, enter into
your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is
in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
<span class="verse">{6:7}</span> In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for
they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. <span class="verse">{6:8}</span>
Therefore don't be like them, for your Father knows what things you
need, before you ask him. <span class="verse">{6:9}</span> Pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven,
may your name be kept holy. <span class="verse">{6:10}</span> Let your Kingdom come. Let your will
be done, as in heaven, so on earth. <span class="verse">{6:11}</span> Give us today our daily
bread. <span class="verse">{6:12}</span> Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
<span class="verse">{6:13}</span> Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever.
Amen.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:14}</span> "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you. <span class="verse">{6:15}</span> But if you don't forgive men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:16}</span> "Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with
sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men
to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their
reward. <span class="verse">{6:17}</span> But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your
face; <span class="verse">{6:18}</span> so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your
Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will
reward you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:19}</span> "Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where
moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
<span class="verse">{6:20}</span> but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal;
<span class="verse">{6:21}</span> for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:22}</span> "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is
sound, your whole body will be full of light. <span class="verse">{6:23}</span> But if your eye is
evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light
that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:24}</span> "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the
one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise
the other. You can't serve both God and Mammon. <span class="verse">{6:25}</span> Therefore I tell
you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you
will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more
than food, and the body more than clothing? <span class="verse">{6:26}</span> See the birds of the
sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns.
Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than
they?</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:27}</span> "Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment
to his lifespan? <span class="verse">{6:28}</span> Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do
they spin, <span class="verse">{6:29}</span> yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was
not dressed like one of these. <span class="verse">{6:30}</span> But if God so clothes the grass
of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:31}</span> "Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?',
'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?' <span class="verse">{6:32}</span> For
the Gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father
knows that you need all these things. <span class="verse">{6:33}</span> But seek first God's
Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to
you as well. <span class="verse">{6:34}</span> Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for
tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:1}</span> "Don't judge, so that you won't be judged. <span class="verse">{7:2}</span> For with
whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever
measure you measure, it will be measured to you. <span class="verse">{7:3}</span> Why do you see
the speck that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam
that is in your own eye? <span class="verse">{7:4}</span> Or how will you tell your brother, 'Let
me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own
eye? <span class="verse">{7:5}</span> You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye,
and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's
eye.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:6}</span> "Don't give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your
pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their
feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:7}</span> "Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find.
Knock, and it will be opened for you. <span class="verse">{7:8}</span> For everyone who asks
receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
<span class="verse">{7:9}</span> Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread,
will give him a stone? <span class="verse">{7:10}</span> Or if he asks for a fish, who will give
him a serpent? <span class="verse">{7:11}</span> If you then, being evil, know how to give good
gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven
give good things to those who ask him! <span class="verse">{7:12}</span> Therefore whatever you
desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the
law and the prophets.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:13}</span> "Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad
is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in
by it. <span class="verse">{7:14}</span> How narrow is the gate, and restricted is the
way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:15}</span> "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's
clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. <span class="verse">{7:16}</span> By their fruits you
will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from
thistles? <span class="verse">{7:17}</span> Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the
corrupt tree produces evil fruit. <span class="verse">{7:18}</span> A good tree can't produce evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. <span class="verse">{7:19}</span> Every tree
that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.
<span class="verse">{7:20}</span> Therefore by their fruits you will know them. <span class="verse">{7:21}</span> Not
everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{7:22}</span>
Many will tell me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your
name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty
works?' <span class="verse">{7:23}</span> Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from
me, you who work iniquity.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:24}</span> "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does
them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house on a rock.
<span class="verse">{7:25}</span> The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and
beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock.
<span class="verse">{7:26}</span> Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will
be like a foolish man, who built his house on the sand. <span class="verse">{7:27}</span> The rain
came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house;
and it fell--and great was its fall."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:28}</span> It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things,
that the multitudes were astonished at his teaching, <span class="verse">{7:29}</span> for he
taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:1}</span> When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
him. <span class="verse">{8:2}</span> Behold, a leper came to him and worshiped him, saying,
"Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:3}</span> Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want
to. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <span class="verse">{8:4}</span> Jesus
said to him, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the
priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to
them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:5}</span> When he came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking
him, <span class="verse">{8:6}</span> and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed,
grievously tormented."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:7}</span> Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:8}</span> The centurion answered, "Lord, I'm not worthy for you to come
under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. <span class="verse">{8:9}</span>
For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I
tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he
comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:10}</span> When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who
followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith,
not even in Israel. <span class="verse">{8:11}</span> I tell you that many will come from the east
and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
Kingdom of Heaven, <span class="verse">{8:12}</span> but the children of the Kingdom will be
thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth." <span class="verse">{8:13}</span> Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be
done for you as you have believed." His servant was healed in that hour.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:14}</span> When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother
lying sick with a fever. <span class="verse">{8:15}</span> He touched her hand, and the fever left
her. She got up and served him. <span class="verse">{8:16}</span> When evening came,
they brought to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits
with a word, and healed all who were sick; <span class="verse">{8:17}</span> that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He took
our infirmities, and bore our diseases." <span class="verse">{8:18}</span> Now when Jesus saw
great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other
side.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:19}</span> A scribe came, and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:20}</span> Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:21}</span> Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first
to go and bury my father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:22}</span> But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury
their own dead."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:23}</span> When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. <span class="verse">{8:24}</span>
Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was
covered with the waves, but he was asleep. <span class="verse">{8:25}</span> They came to him, and
woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:26}</span> He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little
faith?" Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a
great calm.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:27}</span> The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that
even the wind and the sea obey him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:28}</span> When he came to the other side, into the country of the
Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there,
coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass
that way. <span class="verse">{8:29}</span> Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do
with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before
the time?" <span class="verse">{8:30}</span> Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away
from them. <span class="verse">{8:31}</span> The demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out,
permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:32}</span> He said to them, "Go!"</p>

<p>They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole
herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
<span class="verse">{8:33}</span> Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told
everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with
demons. <span class="verse">{8:34}</span> Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they
saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:1}</span> He entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his
own city. <span class="verse">{9:2}</span> Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed,
lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son,
cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:3}</span> Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man
blasphemes."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:4}</span> Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in
your hearts? <span class="verse">{9:5}</span> For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are
forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?' <span class="verse">{9:6}</span> But that you may know
that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then he
said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to
your house."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:7}</span> He arose and departed to his house. <span class="verse">{9:8}</span> But when the
multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:9}</span> As Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man called Matthew
sitting at the tax collection office. He said to him, "Follow me." He
got up and followed him. <span class="verse">{9:10}</span> It happened as he sat in the house,
behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus
and his disciples. <span class="verse">{9:11}</span> When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his
disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:12}</span> When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy
have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. <span class="verse">{9:13}</span> But you
go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,'
for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:14}</span> Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the
Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:15}</span> Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn,
as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
<span class="verse">{9:16}</span> No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the
patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
<span class="verse">{9:17}</span> Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the
skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No,
they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:18}</span> While he told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and
worshiped him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay
your hand on her, and she will live."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:19}</span> Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. <span class="verse">{9:20}</span>
Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind
him, and touched the fringe of his garment; <span class="verse">{9:21}</span> for she
said within herself, "If I just touch his garment, I will be made well."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:22}</span> But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Daughter,
cheer up! Your faith has made you well." And the woman was made well
from that hour.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:23}</span> When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute
players, and the crowd in noisy disorder, <span class="verse">{9:24}</span> he said to them, "Make
room, because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping."</p>

<p>They were ridiculing him. <span class="verse">{9:25}</span> But when the crowd was put out, he
entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <span class="verse">{9:26}</span> The report
of this went out into all that land. <span class="verse">{9:27}</span> As Jesus passed by from
there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, "Have mercy
on us, son of David!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:28}</span> When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him.
Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"</p>

<p>They told him, "Yes, Lord."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:29}</span> Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith
be it done to you." <span class="verse">{9:30}</span> Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly
commanded them, saying, "See that no one knows about this." <span class="verse">{9:31}</span> But
they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:32}</span> As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed
was brought to him. <span class="verse">{9:33}</span> When the demon was cast out, the mute man
spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever
been seen in Israel!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:34}</span> But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of the demons, he
casts out demons."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:35}</span> Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in
their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and
healing every disease and every sickness among the people. <span class="verse">{9:36}</span> But
when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them,
because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without
a shepherd. <span class="verse">{9:37}</span> Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest indeed
is plentiful, but the laborers are few. <span class="verse">{9:38}</span> Pray therefore that the
Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:1}</span> He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them
authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every
disease and every sickness. <span class="verse">{10:2}</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles
are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother;
James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; <span class="verse">{10:3}</span> Philip;
Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of
Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; <span class="verse">{10:4}</span> Simon
the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:5}</span> Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying,
"Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city of the
Samaritans. <span class="verse">{10:6}</span> Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
<span class="verse">{10:7}</span> As you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
<span class="verse">{10:8}</span> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons.
Freely you received, so freely give. <span class="verse">{10:9}</span> Don't take any gold, nor
silver, nor brass in your money belts. <span class="verse">{10:10}</span> Take no bag for your
journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is
worthy of his food. <span class="verse">{10:11}</span> Into whatever city or village you enter,
find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on. <span class="verse">{10:12}</span>
As you enter into the household, greet it. <span class="verse">{10:13}</span> If the household is
worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn't worthy, let your
peace return to you. <span class="verse">{10:14}</span> Whoever doesn't receive you, nor hear your
words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust
from your feet. <span class="verse">{10:15}</span> Most certainly I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment
than for that city.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:16}</span> "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves.
Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. <span class="verse">{10:17}</span> But
beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their
synagogues they will scourge you. <span class="verse">{10:18}</span> Yes, and you will be brought
before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to
the nations. <span class="verse">{10:19}</span> But when they deliver you up, don't be anxious how
or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you
will say. <span class="verse">{10:20}</span> For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your
Father who speaks in you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:21}</span> "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father
his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be
put to death. <span class="verse">{10:22}</span> You will be hated by all men for my name's sake,
but he who endures to the end will be saved. <span class="verse">{10:23}</span> But when they
persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I
tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until
the Son of Man has come.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:24}</span> "A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above
his lord. <span class="verse">{10:25}</span> It is enough for the disciple that he be like his
teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master
of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household! <span class="verse">{10:26}</span>
Therefore don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that
will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known. <span class="verse">{10:27}</span> What I
tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear
whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. <span class="verse">{10:28}</span> Don't be
afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.
Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
Gehenna.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:29}</span> "Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin?
Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,
<span class="verse">{10:30}</span> but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. <span class="verse">{10:31}</span>
Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
<span class="verse">{10:32}</span> Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also
confess before my Father who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{10:33}</span> But whoever denies
me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:34}</span> "Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth. I
didn't come to send peace, but a sword. <span class="verse">{10:35}</span> For I came to set a man
at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. <span class="verse">{10:36}</span> A man's foes will be
those of his own household. <span class="verse">{10:37}</span> He who loves father or mother
more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more
than me isn't worthy of me. <span class="verse">{10:38}</span> He who doesn't take his cross and
follow after me, isn't worthy of me. <span class="verse">{10:39}</span> He who seeks his life will
lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. <span class="verse">{10:40}</span> He
who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who
sent me. <span class="verse">{10:41}</span> He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet
will receive a prophet's reward. He who receives a righteous man in the
name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward. <span class="verse">{10:42}</span>
Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to
drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in
no way lose his reward."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:1}</span> It happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve
disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
<span class="verse">{11:2}</span> Now when John heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent
two of his disciples <span class="verse">{11:3}</span> and said to him, "Are you he who comes, or
should we look for another?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:4}</span> Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you
hear and see: <span class="verse">{11:5}</span> the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have good news preached to them. <span class="verse">{11:6}</span> Blessed is he who
finds no occasion for stumbling in me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:7}</span> As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes
concerning John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A
reed shaken by the wind? <span class="verse">{11:8}</span> But what did you go out to see? A man
in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's
houses. <span class="verse">{11:9}</span> But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell
you, and much more than a prophet. <span class="verse">{11:10}</span> For this is he, of whom it
is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will
prepare your way before you.' <span class="verse">{11:11}</span> Most certainly I tell you,
among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater
than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
greater than he. <span class="verse">{11:12}</span> From the days of John the Baptizer until now,
the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by
force. <span class="verse">{11:13}</span> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until
John. <span class="verse">{11:14}</span> If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is
to come. <span class="verse">{11:15}</span> He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:16}</span> "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like
children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
<span class="verse">{11:17}</span> and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance. We
mourned for you, and you didn't lament.' <span class="verse">{11:18}</span> For John came neither
eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' <span class="verse">{11:19}</span> The Son of
Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is
justified by her children."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:20}</span> Then he began to denounce the cities in which most of his
mighty works had been done, because they didn't repent. <span class="verse">{11:21}</span> "Woe to
you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been
done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes. <span class="verse">{11:22}</span> But I tell you, it will be
more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
<span class="verse">{11:23}</span> You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to
Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which
were done in you, it would have remained until this day. <span class="verse">{11:24}</span> But I
tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the
day of judgment, than for you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:25}</span> At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and
understanding, and revealed them to infants. <span class="verse">{11:26}</span> Yes, Father, for
so it was well-pleasing in your sight. <span class="verse">{11:27}</span> All things have been
delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father;
neither does anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the
Son desires to reveal him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:28}</span> "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and
I will give you rest. <span class="verse">{11:29}</span> Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me,
for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your
souls. <span class="verse">{11:30}</span> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:1}</span> At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain
fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and
to eat. <span class="verse">{12:2}</span> But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him,
"Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:3}</span> But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did, when
he was hungry, and those who were with him; <span class="verse">{12:4}</span> how he entered into
God's house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to
eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
<span class="verse">{12:5}</span> Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the
priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless? <span class="verse">{12:6}</span>
But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. <span class="verse">{12:7}</span> But if
you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,'
you would not have condemned the guiltless. <span class="verse">{12:8}</span> For the Son of Man
is Lord of the Sabbath."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:9}</span> He departed there, and went into their synagogue. <span class="verse">{12:10}</span> And
behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it
lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" that they might accuse him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:11}</span> He said to them, "What man is there among you, who has one
sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't he
grab on to it, and lift it out? <span class="verse">{12:12}</span> Of how much more value then is
a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath
day." <span class="verse">{12:13}</span> Then he told the man, "Stretch out your hand." He
stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
<span class="verse">{12:14}</span> But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they
might destroy him. <span class="verse">{12:15}</span> Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there.
Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, <span class="verse">{12:16}</span> and
commanded them that they should not make him known: <span class="verse">{12:17}</span> that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<span class="verse">{12:18}</span> "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;
   my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:
I will put my Spirit on him.
   He will proclaim justice to the nations.
<span class="verse">{12:19}</span> He will not strive, nor shout;
   neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
<span class="verse">{12:20}</span> He won't break a bruised reed.
   He won't quench a smoking flax,
until he leads justice to victory.
   <span class="verse">{12:21}</span> In his name, the nations will hope."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:22}</span> Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought
to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and
saw. <span class="verse">{12:23}</span> All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be the
son of David?" <span class="verse">{12:24}</span> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said,
"This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of
the demons."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:25}</span> Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or
house divided against itself will not stand. <span class="verse">{12:26}</span> If Satan casts out
Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
<span class="verse">{12:27}</span> If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children
cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. <span class="verse">{12:28}</span> But if I by
the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come
upon you. <span class="verse">{12:29}</span> Or how can one enter into the house of the strong
man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then
he will plunder his house.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:30}</span> "He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn't
gather with me, scatters. <span class="verse">{12:31}</span> Therefore I tell you, every sin and
blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit
will not be forgiven men. <span class="verse">{12:32}</span> Whoever speaks a word against the Son
of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that
which is to come.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:33}</span> "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the
tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its
fruit. <span class="verse">{12:34}</span> You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak
good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
<span class="verse">{12:35}</span> The good man out of his good treasure brings out good things,
and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings out evil things.
<span class="verse">{12:36}</span> I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give
account of it in the day of judgment. <span class="verse">{12:37}</span> For by your words you
will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:38}</span> Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered,
"Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:39}</span> But he answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation
seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah
the prophet. <span class="verse">{12:40}</span> For as Jonah was three days and three nights in
the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth. <span class="verse">{12:41}</span> The men of Nineveh will stand
up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than
Jonah is here. <span class="verse">{12:42}</span> The queen of the south will rise up in the
judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold,
someone greater than Solomon is here. <span class="verse">{12:43}</span> But the unclean spirit,
when he is gone out of the man, passes through waterless places,
seeking rest, and doesn't find it. <span class="verse">{12:44}</span> Then he says, 'I will return
into my house from which I came out,' and when he has come back, he
finds it empty, swept, and put in order. <span class="verse">{12:45}</span> Then he goes, and
takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they
enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than
the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:46}</span> While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his
mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. <span class="verse">{12:47}</span>
One said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside,
seeking to speak to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:48}</span> But he answered him who spoke to him, "Who is my mother? Who
are my brothers?" <span class="verse">{12:49}</span> He stretched out his hand towards his
disciples, and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers! <span class="verse">{12:50}</span> For
whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother,
and sister, and mother."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:1}</span> On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the
seaside. <span class="verse">{13:2}</span> Great multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered
into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach. <span class="verse">{13:3}</span>
He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer
went out to sow. <span class="verse">{13:4}</span> As he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside,
and the birds came and devoured them. <span class="verse">{13:5}</span> Others fell on rocky
ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang
up, because they had no depth of earth. <span class="verse">{13:6}</span> When the sun had risen,
they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.
<span class="verse">{13:7}</span> Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.
<span class="verse">{13:8}</span> Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred
times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. <span class="verse">{13:9}</span> He who has ears to
hear, let him hear."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:10}</span> The disciples came, and said to him, "Why do you speak to
them in parables?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:11}</span> He answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries
of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them. <span class="verse">{13:12}</span> For
whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but
whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken away even that which he
has. <span class="verse">{13:13}</span> Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they
don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.
<span class="verse">{13:14}</span> In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,
'By hearing you will hear,
   and will in no way understand;
Seeing you will see,
   and will in no way perceive:
<span class="verse">{13:15}</span> for this people's heart has grown callous,
   their ears are dull of hearing,
   they have closed their eyes;
or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,
   hear with their ears,
   understand with their heart,
and should turn again;
   and I would heal them.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:16}</span> "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for
they hear. <span class="verse">{13:17}</span> For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and
righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see
them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:18}</span> "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. <span class="verse">{13:19}</span> When anyone
hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one
comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is
what was sown by the roadside. <span class="verse">{13:20}</span> What was sown on the rocky
places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy
receives it; <span class="verse">{13:21}</span> yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a
while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word,
immediately he stumbles. <span class="verse">{13:22}</span> What was sown among the thorns, this
is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
<span class="verse">{13:23}</span> What was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the
word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings
forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:24}</span> He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of
Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, <span class="verse">{13:25}</span> but
while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds
also among the wheat, and went away. <span class="verse">{13:26}</span> But when the blade sprang
up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.
<span class="verse">{13:27}</span> The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir,
didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come
from?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:28}</span> "He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.'</p>

<p>"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:29}</span> "But he said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the
darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them. <span class="verse">{13:30}</span> Let both grow
together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the
reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles
to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:31}</span> He set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of
Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in
his field; <span class="verse">{13:32}</span> which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it
is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the
birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:33}</span> He spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is
like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of
meal, until it was all leavened."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:34}</span> Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes;
and without a parable, he didn't speak to them, <span class="verse">{13:35}</span> that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
"I will open my mouth in parables;
   I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:36}</span> Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the
house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of
the darnel weeds of the field."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:37}</span> He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of
Man, <span class="verse">{13:38}</span> the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the
children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the
evil one. <span class="verse">{13:39}</span> The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is
the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. <span class="verse">{13:40}</span> As therefore
the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at
the end of this age. <span class="verse">{13:41}</span> The Son of Man will send out his angels,
and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause
stumbling, and those who do iniquity, <span class="verse">{13:42}</span> and will cast them into
the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
<span class="verse">{13:43}</span> Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom
of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:44}</span> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in
the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells
all that he has, and buys that field.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:45}</span> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a
merchant seeking fine pearls, <span class="verse">{13:46}</span> who having found one pearl of
great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:47}</span> "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was
cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind, <span class="verse">{13:48}</span> which,
when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and
gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away. <span class="verse">{13:49}</span>
So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and
separate the wicked from among the righteous, <span class="verse">{13:50}</span> and will cast
them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth." <span class="verse">{13:51}</span> Jesus said to them, "Have you understood
all these things?"</p>

<p>They answered him, "Yes, Lord."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:52}</span> He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been made a
disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder,
who brings out of his treasure new and old things."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:53}</span> It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, he
departed from there. <span class="verse">{13:54}</span> Coming into his own country, he taught
them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where
did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works? <span class="verse">{13:55}</span> Isn't
this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his
brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? <span class="verse">{13:56}</span> Aren't all
of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these
things?" <span class="verse">{13:57}</span> They were offended by him.</p>

<p>But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in
his own country, and in his own house." <span class="verse">{13:58}</span> He didn't do many
mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:1}</span> At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning
Jesus, <span class="verse">{14:2}</span> and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He
is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him." <span class="verse">{14:3}</span>
For Herod had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison
for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. <span class="verse">{14:4}</span> For John
said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." <span class="verse">{14:5}</span> When he
would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they
counted him as a prophet. <span class="verse">{14:6}</span> But when Herod's birthday came, the
daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. <span class="verse">{14:7}</span>
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
<span class="verse">{14:8}</span> She, being prompted by her mother, said, "Give me here on a
platter the head of John the Baptizer."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:9}</span> The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of
those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,
<span class="verse">{14:10}</span> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. <span class="verse">{14:11}</span> His head
was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought
it to her mother. <span class="verse">{14:12}</span> His disciples came, and took the body, and
buried it; and they went and told Jesus. <span class="verse">{14:13}</span> Now when Jesus heard
this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When
the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:14}</span> Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had
compassion on them, and healed their sick. <span class="verse">{14:15}</span> When evening had
come, his disciples came to him, saying, "This place is deserted, and
the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go
into the villages, and buy themselves food."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:16}</span> But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You
give them something to eat."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:17}</span> They told him, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:18}</span> He said, "Bring them here to me." <span class="verse">{14:19}</span> He commanded the
multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and
the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the
loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
<span class="verse">{14:20}</span> They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full
of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. <span class="verse">{14:21}</span> Those
who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:22}</span> Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and
to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes
away. <span class="verse">{14:23}</span> After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into
the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there
alone. <span class="verse">{14:24}</span> But the boat was now in the middle of the sea,
distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. <span class="verse">{14:25}</span> In the
fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the
sea. <span class="verse">{14:26}</span> When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they
were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.
<span class="verse">{14:27}</span> But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It
is I! Don't be afraid."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:28}</span> Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it is you, command me
to come to you on the waters."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:29}</span> He said, "Come!"</p>

<p>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come
to Jesus. <span class="verse">{14:30}</span> But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was
afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:31}</span> Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him,
and said to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" <span class="verse">{14:32}</span> When
they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. <span class="verse">{14:33}</span> Those who were in
the boat came and worshiped him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:34}</span> When they had crossed over, they came to the land of
Gennesaret. <span class="verse">{14:35}</span> When the people of that place recognized him, they
sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were
sick, <span class="verse">{14:36}</span> and they begged him that they might just touch the
fringe of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:1}</span> Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem,
saying, <span class="verse">{15:2}</span> "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the
elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:3}</span> He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of
God because of your tradition? <span class="verse">{15:4}</span> For God commanded, 'Honor your
father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or
mother, let him be put to death.' <span class="verse">{15:5}</span> But you say, 'Whoever may
tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have
gotten from me is a gift devoted to God," <span class="verse">{15:6}</span> he shall not honor his
father or mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of
your tradition. <span class="verse">{15:7}</span> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you,
saying,
<span class="verse">{15:8}</span> 'These people draw near to me with their mouth,
   and honor me with their lips;
   but their heart is far from me.
<span class="verse">{15:9}</span> And in vain do they worship me,
   teaching as doctrine rules made by men.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:10}</span> He summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and
understand. <span class="verse">{15:11}</span> That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the
man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:12}</span> Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that
the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:13}</span> But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father
didn't plant will be uprooted. <span class="verse">{15:14}</span> Leave them alone. They are blind
guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into
a pit."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:15}</span> Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:16}</span> So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand? <span class="verse">{15:17}</span>
Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the
belly, and then out of the body? <span class="verse">{15:18}</span> But the things which proceed
out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
<span class="verse">{15:19}</span> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders,
adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
<span class="verse">{15:20}</span> These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with
unwashed hands doesn't defile the man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:21}</span> Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of
Tyre and Sidon. <span class="verse">{15:22}</span> Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those
borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David!
My daughter is severely demonized!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:23}</span> But he answered her not a word.</p>

<p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she
cries after us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:24}</span> But he answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep
of the house of Israel."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:25}</span> But she came and worshiped him, saying, "Lord, help me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:26}</span> But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the
children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:27}</span> But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs
which fall from their masters' table."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:28}</span> Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it
done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that
hour.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:29}</span> Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee;
and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. <span class="verse">{15:30}</span> Great
multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed,
and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
<span class="verse">{15:31}</span> so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking,
injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the
God of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:32}</span> Jesus summoned his disciples and said, "I have compassion on
the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have
nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might
faint on the way."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:33}</span> The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many
loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:34}</span> Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"</p>

<p>They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:35}</span> He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
<span class="verse">{15:36}</span> and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and
broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the
multitudes. <span class="verse">{15:37}</span> They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven
baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. <span class="verse">{15:38}</span> Those
who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. <span class="verse">{15:39}</span>
Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the
borders of Magdala.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:1}</span> The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him
to show them a sign from heaven. <span class="verse">{16:2}</span> But he answered them, "When it
is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
<span class="verse">{16:3}</span> In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is
red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the
appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times!
<span class="verse">{16:4}</span> An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there
will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah."</p>

<p>He left them, and departed. <span class="verse">{16:5}</span> The disciples came to the other
side and had forgotten to take bread. <span class="verse">{16:6}</span> Jesus said to them, "Take
heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:7}</span> They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:8}</span> Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among
yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
<span class="verse">{16:9}</span> Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the
five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <span class="verse">{16:10}</span> Nor the seven
loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <span class="verse">{16:11}</span>
How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning
bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:12}</span> Then they understood that he didn't tell them to beware of
the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<span class="verse">{16:13}</span> Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he
asked his disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man,
am?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:14}</span> They said, "Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and
others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:15}</span> He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:16}</span> Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the
living God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:17}</span> Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for
flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in
heaven. <span class="verse">{16:18}</span> I also tell you that you are Peter, and on
this rock I will build my assembly, and the gates of
Hades will not prevail against it. <span class="verse">{16:19}</span> I will give to you
the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will
have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have
been released in heaven." <span class="verse">{16:20}</span> Then he commanded the disciples that
they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. <span class="verse">{16:21}</span> From that
time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem
and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and
be killed, and the third day be raised up.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:22}</span> Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far
be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:23}</span> But he turned, and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You
are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the
things of God, but on the things of men." <span class="verse">{16:24}</span> Then Jesus said to
his disciples, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <span class="verse">{16:25}</span> For whoever
desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life
for my sake will find it. <span class="verse">{16:26}</span> For what will it profit a man, if he
gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give
in exchange for his life? <span class="verse">{16:27}</span> For the Son of Man will come in the
glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
everyone according to his deeds. <span class="verse">{16:28}</span> Most certainly I tell you,
there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until
they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:1}</span> After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John
his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
<span class="verse">{17:2}</span> He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun,
and his garments became as white as the light. <span class="verse">{17:3}</span> Behold, Moses and
Elijah appeared to them talking with him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:4}</span> Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us
to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one
for Moses, and one for Elijah."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:5}</span> While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This
is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:6}</span> When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and
were very afraid. <span class="verse">{17:7}</span> Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up,
and don't be afraid." <span class="verse">{17:8}</span> Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one,
except Jesus alone. <span class="verse">{17:9}</span> As they were coming down from the mountain,
Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until
the Son of Man has risen from the dead."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:10}</span> His disciples asked him, saying, "Then why do the scribes
say that Elijah must come first?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:11}</span> Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will
restore all things, <span class="verse">{17:12}</span> but I tell you that Elijah has come
already, and they didn't recognize him, but did to him whatever they
wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them." <span class="verse">{17:13}</span>
Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the
Baptizer.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:14}</span> When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling
down to him, saying, <span class="verse">{17:15}</span> "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is
epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire,
and often into the water. <span class="verse">{17:16}</span> So I brought him to your disciples,
and they could not cure him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:17}</span> Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long
will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to
me." <span class="verse">{17:18}</span> Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy
was cured from that hour.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:19}</span> Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why
weren't we able to cast it out?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:20}</span> He said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For most
certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you
will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move;
and nothing will be impossible for you. <span class="verse">{17:21}</span> But this kind doesn't
go out except by prayer and fasting."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:22}</span> While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The
Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, <span class="verse">{17:23}</span>
and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up."</p>

<p>They were exceedingly sorry. <span class="verse">{17:24}</span> When they had come to
Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to
Peter, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?" <span class="verse">{17:25}</span> He
said, "Yes."</p>

<p>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do
you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or
tribute? From their children, or from strangers?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:26}</span> Peter said to him, "From strangers."</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "Therefore the children are exempt. <span class="verse">{17:27}</span> But,
lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up
the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will
find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and
you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:1}</span> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then
is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:2}</span> Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in their
midst, <span class="verse">{18:3}</span> and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn,
and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="verse">{18:4}</span> Whoever therefore humbles himself as this
little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. <span class="verse">{18:5}</span>
Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me, <span class="verse">{18:6}</span>
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to
stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be
hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:7}</span> "Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it
must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom
the occasion comes! <span class="verse">{18:8}</span> If your hand or your foot causes you to
stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <span class="verse">{18:9}</span> If your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast
into the Gehenna of fire. <span class="verse">{18:10}</span> See that you don't despise
one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels
always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{18:11}</span> For the Son
of Man came to save that which was lost.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:12}</span> "What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one
of them goes astray, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine, go to the
mountains, and seek that which has gone astray? <span class="verse">{18:13}</span> If he finds it,
most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the
ninety-nine which have not gone astray. <span class="verse">{18:14}</span> Even so it is not the
will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones
should perish.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:15}</span> "If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault
between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back
your brother. <span class="verse">{18:16}</span> But if he doesn't listen, take one or two more
with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established. <span class="verse">{18:17}</span> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to
the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to
you as a Gentile or a tax collector. <span class="verse">{18:18}</span> Most certainly I tell you,
whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
<span class="verse">{18:19}</span> Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on
earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them
by my Father who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{18:20}</span> For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:21}</span> Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my
brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:22}</span> Jesus said to him, "I don't tell you until seven times, but,
until seventy times seven. <span class="verse">{18:23}</span> Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is
like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
servants. <span class="verse">{18:24}</span> When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to
him who owed him ten thousand talents. <span class="verse">{18:25}</span> But because he
couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his
children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. <span class="verse">{18:26}</span> The
servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, 'Lord, have
patience with me, and I will repay you all!' <span class="verse">{18:27}</span> The lord of that
servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the
debt.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:28}</span> "But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow
servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed
him, and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:29}</span> "So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him,
saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!' <span class="verse">{18:30}</span> He would
not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that
which was due. <span class="verse">{18:31}</span> So when his fellow servants saw what was done,
they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that
was done. <span class="verse">{18:32}</span> Then his lord called him in, and said to him, 'You
wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
<span class="verse">{18:33}</span> Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even
as I had mercy on you?' <span class="verse">{18:34}</span> His lord was angry, and delivered him
to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him. <span class="verse">{18:35}</span>
So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive
your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:1}</span> It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed
from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
<span class="verse">{19:2}</span> Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. <span class="verse">{19:3}</span>
Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, "Is it lawful for a man
to divorce his wife for any reason?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:4}</span> He answered, "Haven't you read that he who made them from the
beginning made them male and female, <span class="verse">{19:5}</span> and said, 'For this
cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his
wife; and the two shall become one flesh?' <span class="verse">{19:6}</span> So that they are
no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together,
don't let man tear apart."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:7}</span> They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give her a
bill of divorce, and divorce her?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:8}</span> He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your
hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it
has not been so. <span class="verse">{19:9}</span> I tell you that whoever divorces his wife,
except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery;
and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:10}</span> His disciples said to him, "If this is the case of the man
with his wife, it is not expedient to marry."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:11}</span> But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this saying,
but those to whom it is given. <span class="verse">{19:12}</span> For there are eunuchs who were
born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were
made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs
for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him
receive it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:13}</span> Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay
his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them. <span class="verse">{19:14}</span> But
Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come
to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these." <span class="verse">{19:15}</span>
He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:16}</span> Behold, one came to him and said, "Good teacher, what good
thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:17}</span> He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one
is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep
the commandments."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:18}</span> He said to him, "Which ones?"</p>

<p>Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit
adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false
testimony.' <span class="verse">{19:19}</span> 'Honor your father and mother.' And, 'You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:20}</span> The young man said to him, "All these things I have observed
from my youth. What do I still lack?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:21}</span> Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what
you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
and come, follow me." <span class="verse">{19:22}</span> But when the young man heard the saying,
he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions. <span class="verse">{19:23}</span>
Jesus said to his disciples, "Most certainly I say to you, a rich man
will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. <span class="verse">{19:24}</span> Again I
tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than
for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:25}</span> When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly
astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:26}</span> Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men this is impossible,
but with God all things are possible."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:27}</span> Then Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and
followed you. What then will we have?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:28}</span> Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who
have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on
the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel. <span class="verse">{19:29}</span> Everyone who has left houses, or
brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will
inherit eternal life. <span class="verse">{19:30}</span> But many will be last who are first; and
first who are last.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:1}</span> "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master
of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for
his vineyard. <span class="verse">{20:2}</span> When he had agreed with the laborers for a
denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. <span class="verse">{20:3}</span> He
went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle
in the marketplace. <span class="verse">{20:4}</span> To them he said, 'You also go into the
vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went their
way. <span class="verse">{20:5}</span> Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth
hour, and did likewise. <span class="verse">{20:6}</span> About the eleventh hour
he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, 'Why do
you stand here all day idle?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:7}</span> "They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.'</p>

<p>"He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and you will
receive whatever is right.' <span class="verse">{20:8}</span> When evening had come, the lord of
the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their
wages, beginning from the last to the first.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:9}</span> "When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came,
they each received a denarius. <span class="verse">{20:10}</span> When the first came, they
supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received
a denarius. <span class="verse">{20:11}</span> When they received it, they murmured against the
master of the household, <span class="verse">{20:12}</span> saying, 'These last have spent one
hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat!'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:13}</span> "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no
wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius? <span class="verse">{20:14}</span> Take that which
is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as
much as to you. <span class="verse">{20:15}</span> Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to
with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?' <span class="verse">{20:16}</span> So
the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but
few are chosen."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:17}</span> As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve
disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, <span class="verse">{20:18}</span> "Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the
chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, <span class="verse">{20:19}</span>
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to
crucify; and the third day he will be raised up."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:20}</span> Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her
sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him. <span class="verse">{20:21}</span> He said to
her, "What do you want?"</p>

<p>She said to him, "Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on
your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:22}</span> But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking. Are
you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "We are able."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:23}</span> He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my
right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom
it has been prepared by my Father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:24}</span> When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two
brothers.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:25}</span> But Jesus summoned them, and said, "You know that the rulers
of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise
authority over them. <span class="verse">{20:26}</span> It shall not be so among you, but whoever
desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
<span class="verse">{20:27}</span> Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your
bondservant, <span class="verse">{20:28}</span> even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but
to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:29}</span> As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed
him. <span class="verse">{20:30}</span> Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard
that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, you son
of David!" <span class="verse">{20:31}</span> The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they
should be quiet, but they cried out even more, "Lord, have mercy on us,
you son of David!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:32}</span> Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you
want me to do for you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:33}</span> They told him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:34}</span> Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and
immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:1}</span> When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to
Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two
disciples, <span class="verse">{21:2}</span> saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite
you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her.
Untie them, and bring them to me. <span class="verse">{21:3}</span> If anyone says anything to
you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and immediately he will send
them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:4}</span> All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through the prophet, saying,
<span class="verse">{21:5}</span> "Tell the daughter of Zion,
   behold, your King comes to you,
   humble, and riding on a donkey,
   on a colt, the foal of a donkey."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:6}</span> The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
<span class="verse">{21:7}</span> and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on
them; and he sat on them. <span class="verse">{21:8}</span> A very great multitude spread their
clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread
them on the road. <span class="verse">{21:9}</span> The multitudes who went before him, and who
followed kept shouting, "Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:10}</span> When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred
up, saying, "Who is this?" <span class="verse">{21:11}</span> The multitudes said, "This is the
prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:12}</span> Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of
those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money
changers' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves. <span class="verse">{21:13}</span> He
said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of
prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:14}</span> The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he
healed them. <span class="verse">{21:15}</span> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the
wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the
temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David!" they were indignant,
<span class="verse">{21:16}</span> and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?"</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of
babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:17}</span> He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and
lodged there. <span class="verse">{21:18}</span> Now in the morning, as he returned to the city,
he was hungry. <span class="verse">{21:19}</span> Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it,
and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, "Let there be no
fruit from you forever!"</p>

<p>Immediately the fig tree withered away. <span class="verse">{21:20}</span> When the disciples
saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree immediately wither
away?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:21}</span> Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, if you have
faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig
tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into
the sea,' it would be done. <span class="verse">{21:22}</span> All things, whatever you ask in
prayer, believing, you will receive."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:23}</span> When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the
elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, "By what
authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:24}</span> Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question,
which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do
these things. <span class="verse">{21:25}</span> The baptism of John, where was it from? From
heaven or from men?"</p>

<p>They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he
will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' <span class="verse">{21:26}</span> But if we say,
'From men,' we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet."
<span class="verse">{21:27}</span> They answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know."</p>

<p>He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I
do these things. <span class="verse">{21:28}</span> But what do you think? A man had two sons, and
he came to the first, and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
<span class="verse">{21:29}</span> He answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind,
and went. <span class="verse">{21:30}</span> He came to the second, and said the same thing. He
answered, 'I go, sir,' but he didn't go. <span class="verse">{21:31}</span> Which of the two did
the will of his father?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "The first."</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that the tax
collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God
before you. <span class="verse">{21:32}</span> For John came to you in the way of righteousness,
and you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes
believed him. When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward, that
you might believe him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:33}</span> "Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a
household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a
winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into
another country. <span class="verse">{21:34}</span> When the season for the fruit drew near, he
sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit. <span class="verse">{21:35}</span> The
farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned
another. <span class="verse">{21:36}</span> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and
they treated them the same way. <span class="verse">{21:37}</span> But afterward he sent to them
his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.' <span class="verse">{21:38}</span> But the farmers,
when they saw the son, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come,
let's kill him, and seize his inheritance.' <span class="verse">{21:39}</span> So they took him,
and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. <span class="verse">{21:40}</span> When
therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those
farmers?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:41}</span> They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable
men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give
him the fruit in its season."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:42}</span> Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures,
'The stone which the builders rejected,
   the same was made the head of the corner.
This was from the Lord.
   It is marvelous in our eyes?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:43}</span> "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away
from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
<span class="verse">{21:44}</span> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on
whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:45}</span> When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
they perceived that he spoke about them. <span class="verse">{21:46}</span> When they sought to
seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to
be a prophet.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:1}</span> Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
<span class="verse">{22:2}</span> "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a
marriage feast for his son, <span class="verse">{22:3}</span> and sent out his servants to call
those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
<span class="verse">{22:4}</span> Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are
invited, "Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings
are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'
<span class="verse">{22:5}</span> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own
farm, another to his merchandise, <span class="verse">{22:6}</span> and the rest grabbed his
servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. <span class="verse">{22:7}</span> When the
king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those
murderers, and burned their city.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:8}</span> "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but
those who were invited weren't worthy. <span class="verse">{22:9}</span> Go therefore to the
intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to
the marriage feast.' <span class="verse">{22:10}</span> Those servants went out into the highways,
and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The
wedding was filled with guests. <span class="verse">{22:11}</span> But when the king came in to
see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing,
<span class="verse">{22:12}</span> and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not
wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless. <span class="verse">{22:13}</span> Then the king
said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw
him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of
teeth will be.' <span class="verse">{22:14}</span> For many are called, but few chosen."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:15}</span> Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might
entrap him in his talk. <span class="verse">{22:16}</span> They sent their disciples to him, along
with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and
teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren't
partial to anyone. <span class="verse">{22:17}</span> Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:18}</span> But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you
test me, you hypocrites? <span class="verse">{22:19}</span> Show me the tax money."</p>

<p>They brought to him a denarius.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:20}</span> He asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:21}</span> They said to him, "Caesar's."</p>

<p>Then he said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:22}</span> When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went
away.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:23}</span> On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no
resurrection) came to him. They asked him, <span class="verse">{22:24}</span> saying, "Teacher,
Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry
his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.' <span class="verse">{22:25}</span> Now there were
with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed
left his wife to his brother. <span class="verse">{22:26}</span> In the same way, the second also,
and the third, to the seventh. <span class="verse">{22:27}</span> After them all, the woman died.
<span class="verse">{22:28}</span> In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the
seven? For they all had her."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:29}</span> But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God. <span class="verse">{22:30}</span> For in the resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in
heaven. <span class="verse">{22:31}</span> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't
you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, <span class="verse">{22:32}</span> 'I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?' God
is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:33}</span> When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his
teaching. <span class="verse">{22:34}</span> But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had
silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. <span class="verse">{22:35}</span> One of
them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him. <span class="verse">{22:36}</span> "Teacher,
which is the greatest commandment in the law?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:37}</span> Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
<span class="verse">{22:38}</span> This is the first and great commandment. <span class="verse">{22:39}</span> A second
likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
<span class="verse">{22:40}</span> The whole law and the prophets depend on these two
commandments."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:41}</span> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
them a question, <span class="verse">{22:42}</span> saying, "What do you think of the Christ?
Whose son is he?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "Of David."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:43}</span> He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him
Lord, saying,
<span class="verse">{22:44}</span> 'The Lord said to my Lord,
   sit on my right hand,
   until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:45}</span> "If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:46}</span> No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man
dare ask him any more questions from that day forth.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:1}</span> Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
<span class="verse">{23:2}</span> saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
<span class="verse">{23:3}</span> All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe
and do, but don't do their works; for they say, and don't do. <span class="verse">{23:4}</span>
For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them
on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help
them. <span class="verse">{23:5}</span> But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make
their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes
of their garments, <span class="verse">{23:6}</span> and love the place of honor at feasts, the
best seats in the synagogues, <span class="verse">{23:7}</span> the salutations in the
marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by men. <span class="verse">{23:8}</span> But don't
you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of
you are brothers. <span class="verse">{23:9}</span> Call no man on the earth your father, for one
is your Father, he who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{23:10}</span> Neither be called masters,
for one is your master, the Christ. <span class="verse">{23:11}</span> But he who is greatest
among you will be your servant. <span class="verse">{23:12}</span> Whoever exalts himself will be
humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:13}</span> "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers.
Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:14}</span> "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because
you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don't enter in
yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to
enter. <span class="verse">{23:15}</span> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he
becomes one, you make him twice as much of a son of Gehenna
as yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:16}</span> "Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by
the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the
temple, he is obligated.' <span class="verse">{23:17}</span> You blind fools! For which is
greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold? <span class="verse">{23:18}</span>
'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the
gift that is on it, he is obligated?' <span class="verse">{23:19}</span> You blind fools! For
which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
<span class="verse">{23:20}</span> He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by
everything on it. <span class="verse">{23:21}</span> He who swears by the temple, swears by it,
and by him who was living in it. <span class="verse">{23:22}</span> He who swears by
heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:23}</span> "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the
weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought
to have done these, and not to have left the other undone. <span class="verse">{23:24}</span> You
blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:25}</span> "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are
full of extortion and unrighteousness. <span class="verse">{23:26}</span> You blind
Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that
its outside may become clean also.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:27}</span> "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are
like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are
full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. <span class="verse">{23:28}</span> Even so you
also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of
hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:29}</span> "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the
righteous, <span class="verse">{23:30}</span> and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our
fathers, we wouldn't have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets.' <span class="verse">{23:31}</span> Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are
children of those who killed the prophets. <span class="verse">{23:32}</span> Fill up, then, the
measure of your fathers. <span class="verse">{23:33}</span> You serpents, you offspring of vipers,
how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna? <span class="verse">{23:34}</span>
Therefore behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some
of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in
your synagogues, and persecute from city to city; <span class="verse">{23:35}</span> that on you
may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you
killed between the sanctuary and the altar. <span class="verse">{23:36}</span> Most certainly I
tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:37}</span> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones
those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your
children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
and you would not! <span class="verse">{23:38}</span> Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
<span class="verse">{23:39}</span> For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say,
'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:1}</span> Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His
disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple. <span class="verse">{24:2}</span>
But he answered them, "You see all of these things, don't you? Most
certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another,
that will not be thrown down."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:3}</span> As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him
privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the
sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:4}</span> Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you
astray. <span class="verse">{24:5}</span> For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the
Christ,' and will lead many astray. <span class="verse">{24:6}</span> You will hear of wars and
rumors of wars. See that you aren't troubled, for all this must happen,
but the end is not yet. <span class="verse">{24:7}</span> For nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and
earthquakes in various places. <span class="verse">{24:8}</span> But all these things are the
beginning of birth pains. <span class="verse">{24:9}</span> Then they will deliver you up to
oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations
for my name's sake. <span class="verse">{24:10}</span> Then many will stumble, and will deliver up
one another, and will hate one another. <span class="verse">{24:11}</span> Many false prophets
will arise, and will lead many astray. <span class="verse">{24:12}</span> Because iniquity will be
multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. <span class="verse">{24:13}</span> But he who endures
to the end, the same will be saved. <span class="verse">{24:14}</span> This Good News of the
Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the
nations, and then the end will come.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:15}</span> "When, therefore, you see the abomination of
desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet,
standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), <span class="verse">{24:16}</span> then
let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <span class="verse">{24:17}</span> Let him who
is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his
house. <span class="verse">{24:18}</span> Let him who is in the field not return back to get his
clothes. <span class="verse">{24:19}</span> But woe to those who are with child and to nursing
mothers in those days! <span class="verse">{24:20}</span> Pray that your flight will not be in the
winter, nor on a Sabbath, <span class="verse">{24:21}</span> for then there will be great
oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until
now, no, nor ever will be. <span class="verse">{24:22}</span> Unless those days had been
shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the
chosen ones, those days will be shortened.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:23}</span> "Then if any man tells you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,'
or, 'There,' don't believe it. <span class="verse">{24:24}</span> For there will arise false
christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and
wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:25}</span> "Behold, I have told you beforehand. <span class="verse">{24:26}</span> If therefore
they tell you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness,' don't go out;
'Behold, he is in the inner rooms,' don't believe it. <span class="verse">{24:27}</span> For as
the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so
will be the coming of the Son of Man. <span class="verse">{24:28}</span> For wherever the carcass
is, there is where the vultures gather together. <span class="verse">{24:29}</span>
But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be
darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from
the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken; <span class="verse">{24:30}</span> and
then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the
tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming
on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory. <span class="verse">{24:31}</span> He will
send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will
gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of
the sky to the other.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:32}</span> "Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch
has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the
summer is near. <span class="verse">{24:33}</span> Even so you also, when you see all these
things, know that it is near, even at the doors. <span class="verse">{24:34}</span> Most certainly
I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all
these things are accomplished. <span class="verse">{24:35}</span> Heaven and earth will pass away,
but my words will not pass away. <span class="verse">{24:36}</span> But no one knows of that day
and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:37}</span> "As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son
of Man. <span class="verse">{24:38}</span> For as in those days which were before the flood they
were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
day that Noah entered into the ship, <span class="verse">{24:39}</span> and they didn't know until
the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the
Son of Man. <span class="verse">{24:40}</span> Then two men will be in the field: one will be
taken and one will be left; <span class="verse">{24:41}</span> two women grinding at the mill, one
will be taken and one will be left. <span class="verse">{24:42}</span> Watch therefore, for you
don't know in what hour your Lord comes. <span class="verse">{24:43}</span> But know this, that if
the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief
was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house
to be broken into. <span class="verse">{24:44}</span> Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that
you don't expect, the Son of Man will come.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:45}</span> "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord
has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
<span class="verse">{24:46}</span> Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he
comes. <span class="verse">{24:47}</span> Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all
that he has. <span class="verse">{24:48}</span> But if that evil servant should say in his heart,
'My lord is delaying his coming,' <span class="verse">{24:49}</span> and begins to beat his fellow
servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards, <span class="verse">{24:50}</span> the lord of
that servant will come in a day when he doesn't expect it, and in an
hour when he doesn't know it, <span class="verse">{24:51}</span> and will cut him in pieces, and
appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and
grinding of teeth will be.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:1}</span> "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who
took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom. <span class="verse">{25:2}</span> Five of
them were foolish, and five were wise. <span class="verse">{25:3}</span> Those who were foolish,
when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, <span class="verse">{25:4}</span> but the wise
took oil in their vessels with their lamps. <span class="verse">{25:5}</span> Now while the
bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. <span class="verse">{25:6}</span> But at
midnight there was a cry, 'Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out
to meet him!' <span class="verse">{25:7}</span> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed
their lamps. <span class="verse">{25:8}</span> The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us  some
of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' <span class="verse">{25:9}</span> But the wise
answered, saying, 'What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go
rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.' <span class="verse">{25:10}</span> While they
went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in
with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. <span class="verse">{25:11}</span>
Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to
us.' <span class="verse">{25:12}</span> But he answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know
you.' <span class="verse">{25:13}</span> Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour
in which the Son of Man is coming.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:14}</span> "For it is like a man, going into another country, who
called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them. <span class="verse">{25:15}</span> To
one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each
according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. <span class="verse">{25:16}</span>
Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them,
and made another five talents. <span class="verse">{25:17}</span> In the same way, he also who got
the two gained another two. <span class="verse">{25:18}</span> But he who received the one went
away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:19}</span> "Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and
reconciled accounts with them. <span class="verse">{25:20}</span> He who received the five talents
came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to
me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides
them.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:21}</span> "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful
servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over
many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:22}</span> "He also who got the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you
delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents
besides them.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:23}</span> "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful
servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over
many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:24}</span> "He also who had received the one talent came and said,
'Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not
sow, and gathering where you did not scatter. <span class="verse">{25:25}</span> I was afraid, and
went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is
yours.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:26}</span> "But his lord answered him, 'You wicked and slothful
servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I
didn't scatter. <span class="verse">{25:27}</span> You ought therefore to have deposited my money
with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own
with interest. <span class="verse">{25:28}</span> Take away therefore the talent from him, and
give it to him who has the ten talents. <span class="verse">{25:29}</span> For to everyone who has
will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn't
have, even that which he has will be taken away. <span class="verse">{25:30}</span> Throw out the
unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:31}</span> "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the
holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
<span class="verse">{25:32}</span> Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will
separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from
the goats. <span class="verse">{25:33}</span> He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the
goats on the left. <span class="verse">{25:34}</span> Then the King will tell those on his right
hand, 'Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world; <span class="verse">{25:35}</span> for I was hungry, and you
gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a
stranger, and you took me in. <span class="verse">{25:36}</span> I was naked, and you clothed me.
I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:37}</span> "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did
we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
<span class="verse">{25:38}</span> When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked,
and clothe you? <span class="verse">{25:39}</span> When did we see you sick, or in prison, and
come to you?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:40}</span> "The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you,
inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my
brothers, you did it to me.' <span class="verse">{25:41}</span> Then he will say also
to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the
eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels; <span class="verse">{25:42}</span>
for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat; I was thirsty,
and you gave me no drink; <span class="verse">{25:43}</span> I was a stranger, and you didn't take
me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you
didn't visit me.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:44}</span> "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see
you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,
and didn't help you?'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{25:45}</span> "Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell
you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you
didn't do it to me.' <span class="verse">{25:46}</span> These will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:1}</span> It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he
said to his disciples, <span class="verse">{26:2}</span> "You know that after two days the
Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be
crucified."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:3}</span> Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the
people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas. <span class="verse">{26:4}</span> They took counsel together that they might take
Jesus by deceit, and kill him. <span class="verse">{26:5}</span> But they said, "Not during the
feast, lest a riot occur among the people."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:6}</span> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
leper, <span class="verse">{26:7}</span> a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very
expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the
table. <span class="verse">{26:8}</span> But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant,
saying, "Why this waste? <span class="verse">{26:9}</span> For this ointment might have been sold
for much, and given to the poor."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:10}</span> However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you
trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me. <span class="verse">{26:11}</span> For
you always have the poor with you; but you don't always have me.
<span class="verse">{26:12}</span> For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare
me for burial. <span class="verse">{26:13}</span> Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good
News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also
be spoken of as a memorial of her."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:14}</span> Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went
to the chief priests, <span class="verse">{26:15}</span> and said, "What are you willing to give
me, that I should deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty
pieces of silver. <span class="verse">{26:16}</span> From that time he sought opportunity to
betray him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:17}</span> Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came
to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to
eat the Passover?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:18}</span> He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell
him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover
at your house with my disciples."'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:19}</span> The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared
the Passover. <span class="verse">{26:20}</span> Now when evening had come, he was reclining at
the table with the twelve disciples. <span class="verse">{26:21}</span> As they were eating, he
said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:22}</span> They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him,
"It isn't me, is it, Lord?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:23}</span> He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish,
the same will betray me. <span class="verse">{26:24}</span> The Son of Man goes, even as it is
written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is
betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:25}</span> Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It isn't me, is it,
Rabbi?"</p>

<p>He said to him, "You said it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:26}</span> As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks
for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take,
eat; this is my body." <span class="verse">{26:27}</span> He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave
to them, saying, "All of you drink it, <span class="verse">{26:28}</span> for this is my blood of
the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of
sins. <span class="verse">{26:29}</span> But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the
vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my
Father's Kingdom." <span class="verse">{26:30}</span> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to
the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:31}</span> Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble
because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd,
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' <span class="verse">{26:32}</span> But after I
am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:33}</span> But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble
because of you, I will never be made to stumble."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:34}</span> Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight,
before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:35}</span> Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not
deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:36}</span> Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and
said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray." <span class="verse">{26:37}</span>
He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be
sorrowful and severely troubled. <span class="verse">{26:38}</span> Then he said to them, "My soul
is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:39}</span> He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me;
nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:40}</span> He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said
to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour? <span class="verse">{26:41}</span> Watch
and pray, that you don't enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is
willing, but the flesh is weak."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:42}</span> Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My
Father, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your
desire be done." <span class="verse">{26:43}</span> He came again and found them sleeping, for
their eyes were heavy. <span class="verse">{26:44}</span> He left them again, went away, and
prayed a third time, saying the same words. <span class="verse">{26:45}</span> Then he came to his
disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold,
the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners. <span class="verse">{26:46}</span> Arise, let's be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at
hand."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:47}</span> While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the
twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs,
from the chief priest and elders of the people. <span class="verse">{26:48}</span> Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one.
Seize him." <span class="verse">{26:49}</span> Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail,
Rabbi!" and kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:50}</span> Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they
came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <span class="verse">{26:51}</span> Behold, one of
those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
<span class="verse">{26:52}</span> Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place,
for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. <span class="verse">{26:53}</span> Or do
you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would even now send me
more than twelve legions of angels? <span class="verse">{26:54}</span> How then would the
Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:55}</span> In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come
out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily
in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. <span class="verse">{26:56}</span> But all this
has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."</p>

<p>Then all the disciples left him, and fled. <span class="verse">{26:57}</span> Those who had
taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes
and the elders were gathered together. <span class="verse">{26:58}</span> But Peter followed him
from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and
sat with the officers, to see the end. <span class="verse">{26:59}</span> Now the chief priests,
the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus,
that they might put him to death; <span class="verse">{26:60}</span> and they found none. Even
though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last
two false witnesses came forward, <span class="verse">{26:61}</span> and said, "This man said, 'I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:62}</span> The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no
answer? What is this that these testify against you?" <span class="verse">{26:63}</span> But Jesus
held his peace. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the
living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of
God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:64}</span> Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell
you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:65}</span> Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has
spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you
have heard his blasphemy. <span class="verse">{26:66}</span> What do you think?"</p>

<p>They answered, "He is worthy of death!" <span class="verse">{26:67}</span> Then they spit in
his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <span class="verse">{26:68}</span>
saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:69}</span> Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came
to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:70}</span> But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what
you are talking about."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:71}</span> When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,
and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of
Nazareth."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:72}</span> Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:73}</span> After a little while those who stood by came and said to
Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you
known."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{26:74}</span> Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"</p>

<p>Immediately the rooster crowed. <span class="verse">{26:75}</span> Peter remembered the word
which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny
me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:1}</span> Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the
elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
<span class="verse">{27:2}</span> and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to
Pontius Pilate, the governor. <span class="verse">{27:3}</span> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when
he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <span class="verse">{27:4}</span> saying,
"I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."</p>

<p>But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:5}</span> He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and
departed. He went away and hanged himself. <span class="verse">{27:6}</span> The chief priests
took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into
the treasury, since it is the price of blood." <span class="verse">{27:7}</span> They took
counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.
<span class="verse">{27:8}</span> Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this
day. <span class="verse">{27:9}</span> Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled, saying,
"They took the thirty pieces of silver,
   the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
   whom some of the children of Israel priced,
<span class="verse">{27:10}</span> and they gave them for the potter's field,
   as the Lord commanded me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:11}</span> Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "So you say."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:12}</span> When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he
answered nothing. <span class="verse">{27:13}</span> Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how
many things they testify against you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:14}</span> He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the
governor marveled greatly. <span class="verse">{27:15}</span> Now at the feast the governor was
accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
<span class="verse">{27:16}</span> They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <span class="verse">{27:17}</span> When
therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do
you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called
Christ?" <span class="verse">{27:18}</span> For he knew that because of envy they had delivered
him up.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:19}</span> While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to
him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him." <span class="verse">{27:20}</span> Now
the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for
Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. <span class="verse">{27:21}</span> But the governor answered them,
"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"</p>

<p>They said, "Barabbas!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:22}</span> Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is
called Christ?"</p>

<p>They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:23}</span> But the governor said, "Why? What evil has he done?"</p>

<p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let him be crucified!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:24}</span> So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather
that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this
righteous person. You see to it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:25}</span> All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our
children!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:26}</span> Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and
delivered to be crucified. <span class="verse">{27:27}</span> Then the governor's soldiers took
Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him. <span class="verse">{27:28}</span> They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.
<span class="verse">{27:29}</span> They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a
reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked
him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" <span class="verse">{27:30}</span> They spat on him, and
took the reed and struck him on the head. <span class="verse">{27:31}</span> When they had mocked
him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led
him away to crucify him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:32}</span> As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name,
and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.
<span class="verse">{27:33}</span> They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The
place of a skull." <span class="verse">{27:34}</span> They gave him sour wine to drink mixed with
gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <span class="verse">{27:35}</span> When they had
crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,
<span class="verse">{27:36}</span> and they sat and watched him there. <span class="verse">{27:37}</span> They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING
OF THE JEWS."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:38}</span> Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his
right hand and one on the left. <span class="verse">{27:39}</span> Those who passed by blasphemed
him, wagging their heads, <span class="verse">{27:40}</span> and saying, "You who destroy the
temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son
of God, come down from the cross!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:41}</span> Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes,
the Pharisees, and the elders, said, <span class="verse">{27:42}</span> "He saved
others, but he can't save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him
come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. <span class="verse">{27:43}</span> He
trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said,
'I am the Son of God.'" <span class="verse">{27:44}</span> The robbers also who were crucified
with him cast on him the same reproach.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:45}</span> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over
all the land until the ninth hour. <span class="verse">{27:46}</span> About the ninth
hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima
sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:47}</span> Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said,
"This man is calling Elijah."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:48}</span> Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink. <span class="verse">{27:49}</span>
The rest said, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:50}</span> Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his
spirit. <span class="verse">{27:51}</span> Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the
top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split. <span class="verse">{27:52}</span>
The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen
asleep were raised; <span class="verse">{27:53}</span> and coming out of the tombs after his
resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
<span class="verse">{27:54}</span> Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,
when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared
exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:55}</span> Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed
Jesus from Galilee, serving him. <span class="verse">{27:56}</span> Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the
sons of Zebedee. <span class="verse">{27:57}</span> When evening had come, a rich man from
Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.
<span class="verse">{27:58}</span> This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be given up. <span class="verse">{27:59}</span> Joseph took the body, and
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <span class="verse">{27:60}</span> and laid it in his own new
tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to
the door of the tomb, and departed. <span class="verse">{27:61}</span> Mary Magdalene was there,
and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <span class="verse">{27:62}</span> Now on the next
day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and
the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate, <span class="verse">{27:63}</span> saying, "Sir,
we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After
three days I will rise again.' <span class="verse">{27:64}</span> Command therefore that the tomb
be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at
night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the
dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{27:65}</span> Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as
secure as you can." <span class="verse">{27:66}</span> So they went with the guard and made the
tomb secure, sealing the stone.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{28:1}</span> Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
<span class="verse">{28:2}</span> Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord
descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the
door, and sat on it. <span class="verse">{28:3}</span> His appearance was like lightning, and his
clothing white as snow. <span class="verse">{28:4}</span> For fear of him, the guards shook, and
became like dead men. <span class="verse">{28:5}</span> The angel answered the women, "Don't be
afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <span class="verse">{28:6}</span>
He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the
place where the Lord was lying. <span class="verse">{28:7}</span> Go quickly and tell his
disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you
into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{28:8}</span> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy,
and ran to bring his disciples word. <span class="verse">{28:9}</span> As they went to tell his
disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"</p>

<p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{28:10}</span> Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my
brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they
will see me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{28:11}</span> Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came
into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had
happened. <span class="verse">{28:12}</span> When they were assembled with the elders, and had
taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
<span class="verse">{28:13}</span> saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him
away while we slept. <span class="verse">{28:14}</span> If this comes to the governor's ears, we
will persuade him and make you free of worry." <span class="verse">{28:15}</span> So they took the
money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among
the Jews, and continues until this day.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{28:16}</span> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain
where Jesus had sent them. <span class="verse">{28:17}</span> When they saw him, they bowed down
to him, but some doubted. <span class="verse">{28:18}</span> Jesus came to them and spoke to them,
saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
<span class="verse">{28:19}</span> Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <span class="verse">{28:20}</span>
teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am
with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.</p>


<h2>Mark</h2>

<p><span class="verse">{1:1}</span> The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God. <span class="verse">{1:2}</span> As it is written in the prophets,
"Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
   who will prepare your way before you.
<span class="verse">{1:3}</span> The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
   'Make ready the way of the Lord!
   Make his paths straight!'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:4}</span> John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching
the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins. <span class="verse">{1:5}</span> All the
country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were
baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins. <span class="verse">{1:6}</span> John
was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He
ate locusts and wild honey. <span class="verse">{1:7}</span> He preached, saying, "After me comes
he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy
to stoop down and loosen. <span class="verse">{1:8}</span> I baptized you in water, but he
will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:9}</span> It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span class="verse">{1:10}</span> Immediately
coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit
descending on him like a dove. <span class="verse">{1:11}</span> A voice came out of the sky, "You
are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:12}</span> Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
<span class="verse">{1:13}</span> He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He
was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:14}</span> Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into
Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God, <span class="verse">{1:15}</span> and
saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand!
Repent, and believe in the Good News."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:16}</span> Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew
the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were
fishermen. <span class="verse">{1:17}</span> Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make
you into fishers for men."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:18}</span> Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. <span class="verse">{1:19}</span>
Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee,
and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
<span class="verse">{1:20}</span> Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee,
in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. <span class="verse">{1:21}</span> They
went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into
the synagogue and taught. <span class="verse">{1:22}</span> They were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <span class="verse">{1:23}</span>
Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,
and he cried out, <span class="verse">{1:24}</span> saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you,
Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you
are: the Holy One of God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:25}</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:26}</span> The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud
voice, came out of him. <span class="verse">{1:27}</span> They were all amazed, so that they
questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For
with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey
him!" <span class="verse">{1:28}</span> The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all
the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:29}</span> Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they
came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. <span class="verse">{1:30}</span>
Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they
told him about her. <span class="verse">{1:31}</span> He came and took her by the hand, and raised
her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <span class="verse">{1:32}</span> At evening,
when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those
who were possessed by demons. <span class="verse">{1:33}</span> All the city was gathered together
at the door. <span class="verse">{1:34}</span> He healed many who were sick with various diseases,
and cast out many demons. He didn't allow the demons to speak, because
they knew him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:35}</span> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and
went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. <span class="verse">{1:36}</span>
Simon and those who were with him followed after him; <span class="verse">{1:37}</span> and they
found him, and told him, "Everyone is looking for you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:38}</span> He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns,
that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason."
<span class="verse">{1:39}</span> He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching
and casting out demons.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:40}</span> A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and
saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:41}</span> Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and
touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean." <span class="verse">{1:42}</span> When
he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was
made clean. <span class="verse">{1:43}</span> He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him
out, <span class="verse">{1:44}</span> and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go
show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things
which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:45}</span> But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread
about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city,
but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:1}</span> When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was
heard that he was in the house. <span class="verse">{2:2}</span> Immediately many were gathered
together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and
he spoke the word to them. <span class="verse">{2:3}</span> Four people came, carrying a paralytic
to him. <span class="verse">{2:4}</span> When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they
removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let
down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. <span class="verse">{2:5}</span> Jesus, seeing their
faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:6}</span> But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and
reasoning in their hearts, <span class="verse">{2:7}</span> "Why does this man speak blasphemies
like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:8}</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so
reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these
things in your hearts? <span class="verse">{2:9}</span> Which is easier, to tell the paralytic,
'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and
walk?' <span class="verse">{2:10}</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority
on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--<span class="verse">{2:11}</span> "I tell
you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:12}</span> He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in
front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God,
saying, "We never saw anything like this!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:13}</span> He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to
him, and he taught them. <span class="verse">{2:14}</span> As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son
of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow
me." And he arose and followed him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:15}</span> It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house,
and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his
disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <span class="verse">{2:16}</span> The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the
sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he
eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:17}</span> When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy
have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:18}</span> John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they
came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the
Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:19}</span> Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the
bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them,
they can't fast. <span class="verse">{2:20}</span> But the days will come when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day. <span class="verse">{2:21}</span> No
one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch
shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.
<span class="verse">{2:22}</span> No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine
will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be
destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:23}</span> It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the
grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears
of grain. <span class="verse">{2:24}</span> The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do
that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:25}</span> He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he
had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him? <span class="verse">{2:26}</span> How
he entered into God's house when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the
show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave
also to those who were with him?" <span class="verse">{2:27}</span> He said to them, "The Sabbath
was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. <span class="verse">{2:28}</span> Therefore the Son of
Man is lord even of the Sabbath."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:1}</span> He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there
who had his hand withered. <span class="verse">{3:2}</span> They watched him, whether he would
heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <span class="verse">{3:3}</span> He said
to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up." <span class="verse">{3:4}</span> He said to
them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To
save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent. <span class="verse">{3:5}</span> When he had
looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of
their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched
it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <span class="verse">{3:6}</span> The
Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians
against him, how they might destroy him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:7}</span> Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great
multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, <span class="verse">{3:8}</span> from Jerusalem,
from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon.
A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. <span class="verse">{3:9}</span>
He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him
because of the crowd, so that they wouldn't press on him. <span class="verse">{3:10}</span> For he
had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that
they might touch him. <span class="verse">{3:11}</span> The unclean spirits, whenever they saw
him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!" <span class="verse">{3:12}</span>
He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:13}</span> He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those
whom he wanted, and they went to him. <span class="verse">{3:14}</span> He appointed twelve, that
they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
<span class="verse">{3:15}</span> and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
<span class="verse">{3:16}</span> Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter; <span class="verse">{3:17}</span> James the son of
Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges,
which means, Sons of Thunder; <span class="verse">{3:18}</span> Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew;
Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the
Zealot; <span class="verse">{3:19}</span> and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>

<p>He came into a house. <span class="verse">{3:20}</span> The multitude came together again, so
that they could not so much as eat bread. <span class="verse">{3:21}</span> When his friends heard
it, they went out to seize him: for they said, "He is insane." <span class="verse">{3:22}</span>
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and,
"By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:23}</span> He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can
Satan cast out Satan? <span class="verse">{3:24}</span> If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand. <span class="verse">{3:25}</span> If a house is divided against itself,
that house cannot stand. <span class="verse">{3:26}</span> If Satan has risen up against himself,
and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end. <span class="verse">{3:27}</span> But no one can
enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first
binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house. <span class="verse">{3:28}</span> Most
certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be
forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;
<span class="verse">{3:29}</span> but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has
forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"<span class="verse">{3:30}</span> --because they
said, "He has an unclean spirit."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:31}</span> His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they
sent to him, calling him. <span class="verse">{3:32}</span> A multitude was sitting around him,
and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your
sisters are outside looking for you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:33}</span> He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?" <span class="verse">{3:34}</span>
Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother
and my brothers! <span class="verse">{3:35}</span> For whoever does the will of God, the same is
my brother, and my sister, and mother."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:1}</span> Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was
gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat
down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea. <span class="verse">{4:2}</span> He taught
them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, <span class="verse">{4:3}</span>
"Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow, <span class="verse">{4:4}</span> and it happened, as
he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and
devoured it. <span class="verse">{4:5}</span> Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little
soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.
<span class="verse">{4:6}</span> When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no
root, it withered away. <span class="verse">{4:7}</span> Others fell among the thorns, and the
thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <span class="verse">{4:8}</span> Others
fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and
increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some
one hundred times as much."<span class="verse">{4:9}</span> He said, "Whoever has ears to hear,
let him hear."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:10}</span> When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve
asked him about the parables. <span class="verse">{4:11}</span> He said to them, "To you is given
the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all
things are done in parables, <span class="verse">{4:12}</span> that 'seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:13}</span> He said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How will
you understand all of the parables? <span class="verse">{4:14}</span> The farmer sows the word.
<span class="verse">{4:15}</span> The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and
when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word
which has been sown in them. <span class="verse">{4:16}</span> These in the same way are those who
are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word,
immediately receive it with joy. <span class="verse">{4:17}</span> They have no root in
themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises
because of the word, immediately they stumble. <span class="verse">{4:18}</span> Others are those
who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,
<span class="verse">{4:19}</span> and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and
the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes
unfruitful. <span class="verse">{4:20}</span> Those which were sown on the good ground are those
who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times,
some sixty times, and some one hundred times."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:21}</span> He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under a
basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a stand? <span class="verse">{4:22}</span> For
there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither
was anything made secret, but that it should come to light. <span class="verse">{4:23}</span> If
any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:24}</span> He said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With whatever
measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given
to you who hear. <span class="verse">{4:25}</span> For whoever has, to him will more be given, and
he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from
him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:26}</span> He said, "The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed
on the earth, <span class="verse">{4:27}</span> and should sleep and rise night and day, and the
seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how. <span class="verse">{4:28}</span> For the
earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain
in the ear. <span class="verse">{4:29}</span> But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts
forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:30}</span> He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what
parable will we illustrate it? <span class="verse">{4:31}</span> It's like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all
the seeds that are on the earth, <span class="verse">{4:32}</span> yet when it is sown, grows up,
and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so
that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:33}</span> With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they
were able to hear it. <span class="verse">{4:34}</span> Without a parable he didn't speak to them;
but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:35}</span> On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's
go over to the other side." <span class="verse">{4:36}</span> Leaving the multitude, they took him
with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also
with him. <span class="verse">{4:37}</span> A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the
boat, so much that the boat was already filled. <span class="verse">{4:38}</span> He himself was
in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told
him, "Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:39}</span> He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace!
Be still!" The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <span class="verse">{4:40}</span> He said
to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:41}</span> They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then
is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:1}</span> They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of
the Gadarenes. <span class="verse">{5:2}</span> When he had come out of the boat, immediately a
man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <span class="verse">{5:3}</span> He lived in
the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, <span class="verse">{5:4}</span>
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains
had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody
had the strength to tame him. <span class="verse">{5:5}</span> Always, night and day, in the tombs
and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with
stones. <span class="verse">{5:6}</span> When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to
him, <span class="verse">{5:7}</span> and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to
do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God,
don't torment me." <span class="verse">{5:8}</span> For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you
unclean spirit!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:9}</span> He asked him, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many." <span class="verse">{5:10}</span> He
begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
<span class="verse">{5:11}</span> Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
<span class="verse">{5:12}</span> All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that
we may enter into them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:13}</span> At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came
out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed
down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
<span class="verse">{5:14}</span> Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the
country.</p>

<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened. <span class="verse">{5:15}</span> They
came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting,
clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they
were afraid. <span class="verse">{5:16}</span> Those who saw it declared to them how it happened
to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. <span class="verse">{5:17}</span> They
began to beg him to depart from their region.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:18}</span> As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed
by demons begged him that he might be with him. <span class="verse">{5:19}</span> He didn't allow
him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them
what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on
you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:20}</span> He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus
had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:21}</span> When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other
side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.
<span class="verse">{5:22}</span> Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name,
came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, <span class="verse">{5:23}</span> and begged him much,
saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:24}</span> He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and
they pressed upon him on all sides. <span class="verse">{5:25}</span> A certain woman, who had an
issue of blood for twelve years, <span class="verse">{5:26}</span> and had suffered many things by
many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse, <span class="verse">{5:27}</span> having heard the things concerning Jesus,
came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. <span class="verse">{5:28}</span> For
she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well." <span class="verse">{5:29}</span>
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her
body that she was healed of her affliction.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:30}</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had
gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched
my clothes?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:31}</span> His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing
against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:32}</span> He looked around to see her who had done this thing. <span class="verse">{5:33}</span>
But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to
her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:34}</span> He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go
in peace, and be cured of your disease."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:35}</span> While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue
ruler's house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher
any more?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:36}</span> But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said
to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe." <span class="verse">{5:37}</span>
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the
brother of James. <span class="verse">{5:38}</span> He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he
saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <span class="verse">{5:39}</span> When he had entered
in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is
not dead, but is asleep."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:40}</span> They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the
father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went
in where the child was lying. <span class="verse">{5:41}</span> Taking the child by the hand, he
said to her, "Talitha cumi!" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I
tell you, get up!" <span class="verse">{5:42}</span> Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for
she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. <span class="verse">{5:43}</span>
He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded
that something should be given to her to eat.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:1}</span> He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his
disciples followed him. <span class="verse">{6:2}</span> When the Sabbath had come, he began to
teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying,
"Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is
given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
<span class="verse">{6:3}</span> Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James,
Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" They were
offended at him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:4}</span> Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in
his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
<span class="verse">{6:5}</span> He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands
on a few sick people, and healed them. <span class="verse">{6:6}</span> He marveled because of
their unbelief.</p>

<p>He went around the villages teaching. <span class="verse">{6:7}</span> He called to himself the
twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them
authority over the unclean spirits. <span class="verse">{6:8}</span> He commanded them that they
should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread,
no wallet, no money in their purse, <span class="verse">{6:9}</span> but to wear sandals, and not
put on two tunics. <span class="verse">{6:10}</span> He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a
house, stay there until you depart from there. <span class="verse">{6:11}</span> Whoever will not
receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust
that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell
you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that city!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:12}</span> They went out and preached that people should repent. <span class="verse">{6:13}</span>
They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick,
and healed them. <span class="verse">{6:14}</span> King Herod heard this, for his name had become
known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and
therefore these powers are at work in him." <span class="verse">{6:15}</span> But others said, "He
is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the
prophets." <span class="verse">{6:16}</span> But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John,
whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead." <span class="verse">{6:17}</span> For Herod himself
had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of
Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her. <span class="verse">{6:18}</span> For
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's
wife." <span class="verse">{6:19}</span> Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill
him, but she couldn't, <span class="verse">{6:20}</span> for Herod feared John, knowing that he
was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he
did many things, and he heard him gladly.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:21}</span> Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a
supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.
<span class="verse">{6:22}</span> When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she
pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young
lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." <span class="verse">{6:23}</span> He
swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to
half of my kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:24}</span> She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"</p>

<p>She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:25}</span> She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I
want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a
platter."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:26}</span> The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his
oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn't wish to refuse her. <span class="verse">{6:27}</span>
Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to
bring John's head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison, <span class="verse">{6:28}</span>
and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and
the young lady gave it to her mother.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:29}</span> When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his
corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:30}</span> The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they
told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had
taught. <span class="verse">{6:31}</span> He said to them, "You come apart into a deserted place,
and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no
leisure so much as to eat. <span class="verse">{6:32}</span> They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves. <span class="verse">{6:33}</span> They saw them going, and
many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They
arrived before them and came together to him. <span class="verse">{6:34}</span> Jesus came out,
saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were
like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
<span class="verse">{6:35}</span> When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and
said, "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day. <span class="verse">{6:36}</span> Send
them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages,
and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:37}</span> But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."</p>

<p>They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii
worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:38}</span> He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see."</p>

<p>When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:39}</span> He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on
the green grass. <span class="verse">{6:40}</span> They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by
fifties. <span class="verse">{6:41}</span> He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking
up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his
disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them
all. <span class="verse">{6:42}</span> They all ate, and were filled. <span class="verse">{6:43}</span> They took up twelve
baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. <span class="verse">{6:44}</span> Those who
ate the loaves were five thousand men.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:45}</span> Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to
go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the
multitude away. <span class="verse">{6:46}</span> After he had taken leave of them, he went up the
mountain to pray.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:47}</span> When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea,
and he was alone on the land. <span class="verse">{6:48}</span> Seeing them distressed in rowing,
for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night
he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by
them, <span class="verse">{6:49}</span> but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed
that it was a ghost, and cried out; <span class="verse">{6:50}</span> for they all saw him, and
were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them,
"Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid." <span class="verse">{6:51}</span> He got into the
boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among
themselves, and marveled; <span class="verse">{6:52}</span> for they hadn't understood about the
loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:53}</span> When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret,
and moored to the shore. <span class="verse">{6:54}</span> When they had come out of the boat,
immediately the people recognized him, <span class="verse">{6:55}</span> and ran around that whole
region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where
they heard he was. <span class="verse">{6:56}</span> Wherever he entered, into villages, or into
cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces,
and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his
garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:1}</span> Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together
to him, having come from Jerusalem. <span class="verse">{7:2}</span> Now when they saw some of his
disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they
found fault. <span class="verse">{7:3}</span> (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat
unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of
the elders. <span class="verse">{7:4}</span> They don't eat when they come from the marketplace,
unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which
they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze
vessels, and couches.) <span class="verse">{7:5}</span> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him,
"Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the
elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:6}</span> He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites,
as it is written,
'This people honors me with their lips,
   but their heart is far from me.
<span class="verse">{7:7}</span> But in vain do they worship me,
   teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:8}</span> "For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to
the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many
other such things." <span class="verse">{7:9}</span> He said to them, "Full well do you reject the
commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. <span class="verse">{7:10}</span> For Moses
said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil
of father or mother, let him be put to death.' <span class="verse">{7:11}</span> But you say,
'If a man tells his father or his mother, "Whatever profit you might
have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to
God";' <span class="verse">{7:12}</span> then you no longer allow him to do anything for his
father or his mother, <span class="verse">{7:13}</span> making void the word of God by your
tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:14}</span> He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them,
"Hear me, all of you, and understand. <span class="verse">{7:15}</span> There is nothing from
outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things
which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. <span class="verse">{7:16}</span> If
anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:17}</span> When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his
disciples asked him about the parable. <span class="verse">{7:18}</span> He said to them, "Are you
thus without understanding also? Don't you perceive that whatever goes
into the man from outside can't defile him, <span class="verse">{7:19}</span> because it doesn't
go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus
purifying all foods?" <span class="verse">{7:20}</span> He said, "That which proceeds
out of the man, that defiles the man. <span class="verse">{7:21}</span> For from within, out of
the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins,
murders, thefts, <span class="verse">{7:22}</span> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires,
an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. <span class="verse">{7:23}</span> All these evil
things come from within, and defile the man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:24}</span> From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre
and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it,
but he couldn't escape notice. <span class="verse">{7:25}</span> For a woman, whose little
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down
at his feet. <span class="verse">{7:26}</span> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by
race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
<span class="verse">{7:27}</span> But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it
is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the
dogs."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:28}</span> But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the
table eat the children's crumbs."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:29}</span> He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has
gone out of your daughter."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:30}</span> She went away to her house, and found the child having been
laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:31}</span> Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and
came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of
Decapolis. <span class="verse">{7:32}</span> They brought to him one who was deaf and had an
impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
<span class="verse">{7:33}</span> He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his
fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue. <span class="verse">{7:34}</span>
Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is,
"Be opened!" <span class="verse">{7:35}</span> Immediately his ears were opened, and the
impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. <span class="verse">{7:36}</span> He
commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded
them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. <span class="verse">{7:37}</span> They were
astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He
makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:1}</span> In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they
had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to
them, <span class="verse">{8:2}</span> "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have
stayed with me now three days, and have nothing to eat. <span class="verse">{8:3}</span> If I send
them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some
of them have come a long way."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:4}</span> His disciples answered him, "From where could one satisfy
these people with bread here in a deserted place?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:5}</span> He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"</p>

<p>They said, "Seven."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:6}</span> He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he
took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave
them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude. <span class="verse">{8:7}</span>
They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these
also. <span class="verse">{8:8}</span> They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of
broken pieces that were left over. <span class="verse">{8:9}</span> Those who had eaten were about
four thousand. Then he sent them away.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:10}</span> Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and
came into the region of Dalmanutha. <span class="verse">{8:11}</span> The Pharisees came out and
began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing
him. <span class="verse">{8:12}</span> He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this
generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign
will be given to this generation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:13}</span> He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to
the other side. <span class="verse">{8:14}</span> They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have
more than one loaf in the boat with them. <span class="verse">{8:15}</span> He warned them,
saying, "Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast
of Herod."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:16}</span> They reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we have
no bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:17}</span> Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, "Why do you reason that
it's because you have no bread? Don't you perceive yet, neither
understand? Is your heart still hardened? <span class="verse">{8:18}</span> Having eyes, don't you
see? Having ears, don't you hear? Don't you remember? <span class="verse">{8:19}</span> When I
broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of
broken pieces did you take up?"</p>

<p>They told him, "Twelve."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:20}</span> "When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many
baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?"</p>

<p>They told him, "Seven."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:21}</span> He asked them, "Don't you understand, yet?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:22}</span> He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and
begged him to touch him. <span class="verse">{8:23}</span> He took hold of the blind man by the
hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes,
and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:24}</span> He looked up, and said, "I see men; for I see them like trees
walking."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:25}</span> Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently,
and was restored, and saw everyone clearly. <span class="verse">{8:26}</span> He sent him away to
his house, saying, "Don't enter into the village, nor tell anyone in
the village."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:27}</span> Jesus went out, with his disciples, into the villages of
Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say
that I am?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:28}</span> They told him, "John the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but
others: one of the prophets."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:29}</span> He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</p>

<p>Peter answered, "You are the Christ."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:30}</span> He commanded them that they should tell no one about him.
<span class="verse">{8:31}</span> He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many
things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the
scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <span class="verse">{8:32}</span> He
spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <span class="verse">{8:33}</span>
But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and
said, "Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of
God, but the things of men."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:34}</span> He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and
said to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross, and follow me. <span class="verse">{8:35}</span> For whoever wants to save
his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and
the sake of the Good News will save it. <span class="verse">{8:36}</span> For what does it profit
a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? <span class="verse">{8:37}</span> For what
will a man give in exchange for his life? <span class="verse">{8:38}</span> For whoever will be
ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory
of his Father with the holy angels."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:1}</span> He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there are some
standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom
of God come with power."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:2}</span> After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and
brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves, and he
was changed into another form in front of them. <span class="verse">{9:3}</span> His clothing
became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer
on earth can whiten them. <span class="verse">{9:4}</span> Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and
they were talking with Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:5}</span> Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.
Let's make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah." <span class="verse">{9:6}</span> For he didn't know what to say, for they were very
afraid.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:7}</span> A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the
cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:8}</span> Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more,
except Jesus only.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:9}</span> As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them
that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the
Son of Man had risen from the dead. <span class="verse">{9:10}</span> They kept this saying to
themselves, questioning what the "rising from the dead" meant.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:11}</span> They asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah
must come first?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:12}</span> He said to them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all
things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer
many things and be despised? <span class="verse">{9:13}</span> But I tell you that Elijah has
come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as
it is written about him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:14}</span> Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around
them, and scribes questioning them. <span class="verse">{9:15}</span> Immediately all the
multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him
greeted him. <span class="verse">{9:16}</span> He asked the scribes, "What are you asking them?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:17}</span> One of the multitude answered, "Teacher, I brought to you my
son, who has a mute spirit; <span class="verse">{9:18}</span> and wherever it seizes him, it
throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and
wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren't
able."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:19}</span> He answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be
with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:20}</span> They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the
spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming
at the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:21}</span> He asked his father, "How long has it been since this has
come to him?"</p>

<p>He said, "From childhood. <span class="verse">{9:22}</span> Often it has cast him both into the
fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:23}</span> Jesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are
possible to him who believes."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:24}</span> Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, "I
believe. Help my unbelief!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:25}</span> When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he
rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "You mute and deaf spirit, I
command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:26}</span> Having cried out, and convulsed greatly, it came out of him.
The boy became like one dead; so much that most of them said, "He is
dead." <span class="verse">{9:27}</span> But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he
arose.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:28}</span> When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, "Why couldn't we cast it out?" <span class="verse">{9:29}</span> He said to them, "This
kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:30}</span> They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He
didn't want anyone to know it. <span class="verse">{9:31}</span> For he was teaching his
disciples, and said to them, "The Son of Man is being handed over to
the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the
third day he will rise again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:32}</span> But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask
him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:33}</span> He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked
them, "What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:34}</span> But they were silent, for they had disputed one with another
on the way about who was the greatest.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:35}</span> He sat down, and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If
any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of
all." <span class="verse">{9:36}</span> He took a little child, and set him in their midst. Taking
him in his arms, he said to them, <span class="verse">{9:37}</span> "Whoever receives one such
little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me, doesn't
receive me, but him who sent me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:38}</span> John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone who doesn't follow
us casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he
doesn't follow us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:39}</span> But Jesus said, "Don't forbid him, for there is no one who
will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of
me. <span class="verse">{9:40}</span> For whoever is not against us is on our side. <span class="verse">{9:41}</span> For
whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you
are Christ's, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his
reward. <span class="verse">{9:42}</span> Whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe
in me to stumble, it would be better for him if he were thrown into the
sea with a millstone hung around his neck. <span class="verse">{9:43}</span> If your hand causes
you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life
maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna,
into the unquenchable fire, <span class="verse">{9:44}</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and
the fire is not quenched.' <span class="verse">{9:45}</span> If your foot causes you to stumble,
cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than
having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire
that will never be quenched--<span class="verse">{9:46}</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and
the fire is not quenched.' <span class="verse">{9:47}</span> If your eye causes you to stumble,
cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with
one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the
Gehenna of fire, <span class="verse">{9:48}</span> 'where their worm doesn't die, and
the fire is not quenched.' <span class="verse">{9:49}</span> For everyone will be salted with
fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. <span class="verse">{9:50}</span> Salt is
good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season
it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:1}</span> He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and
beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually
did, he was again teaching them. <span class="verse">{10:2}</span> Pharisees came to him testing
him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:3}</span> He answered, "What did Moses command you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:4}</span> They said, "Moses allowed a certificate of divorce to be
written, and to divorce her."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:5}</span> But Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart, he wrote
you this commandment. <span class="verse">{10:6}</span> But from the beginning of the creation,
God made them male and female. <span class="verse">{10:7}</span> For this cause a man will
leave his father and mother, and will join to his wife, <span class="verse">{10:8}</span> and the
two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer two, but one
flesh. <span class="verse">{10:9}</span> What therefore God has joined together, let no man
separate."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:10}</span> In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same
matter. <span class="verse">{10:11}</span> He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife, and
marries another, commits adultery against her. <span class="verse">{10:12}</span> If a woman
herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits
adultery."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:13}</span> They were bringing to him little children, that he should
touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them.
<span class="verse">{10:14}</span> But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said
to them, "Allow the little children to come to me! Don't forbid them,
for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <span class="verse">{10:15}</span> Most certainly
I tell you, whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little
child, he will in no way enter into it." <span class="verse">{10:16}</span> He took them in his
arms, and blessed them, laying his hands on them.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:17}</span> As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt
before him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may
inherit eternal life?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:18}</span> Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good
except one--God. <span class="verse">{10:19}</span> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder,'
'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not give false
testimony,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and mother.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:20}</span> He said to him, "Teacher, I have observed all these things
from my youth."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:21}</span> Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, "One thing
you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you
will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:22}</span> But his face fell at that saying, and he went away
sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions. <span class="verse">{10:23}</span> Jesus
looked around, and said to his disciples, "How difficult it is for
those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:24}</span> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered
again, "Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter
into the Kingdom of God! <span class="verse">{10:25}</span> It is easier for a camel to go through
a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:26}</span> They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, "Then who
can be saved?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:27}</span> Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible,
but not with God, for all things are possible with God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:28}</span> Peter began to tell him, "Behold, we have left all, and have
followed you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:29}</span> Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who
has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,
<span class="verse">{10:30}</span> but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time,
houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with
persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. <span class="verse">{10:31}</span> But many who
are first will be last; and the last first."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:32}</span> They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was
going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed
were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the
things that were going to happen to him. <span class="verse">{10:33}</span> "Behold, we are going
up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests
and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him
to the Gentiles. <span class="verse">{10:34}</span> They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him,
and kill him. On the third day he will rise again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:35}</span> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came near to him,
saying, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we will ask."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:36}</span> He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:37}</span> They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one at your
right hand, and one at your left hand, in your glory."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:38}</span> But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking.
Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:39}</span> They said to him, "We are able."</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink,
and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with;
<span class="verse">{10:40}</span> but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to
give, but for whom it has been prepared."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:41}</span> When the ten heard it, they began to be indignant towards
James and John.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:42}</span> Jesus summoned them, and said to them, "You know that they
who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and
their great ones exercise authority over them. <span class="verse">{10:43}</span> But it shall not
be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be
your servant. <span class="verse">{10:44}</span> Whoever of you wants to become first among you,
shall be bondservant of all. <span class="verse">{10:45}</span> For the Son of Man also came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:46}</span> They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his
disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a
blind beggar, was sitting by the road. <span class="verse">{10:47}</span> When he heard that it
was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, you son
of David, have mercy on me!" <span class="verse">{10:48}</span> Many rebuked him, that he should
be quiet, but he cried out much more, "You son of David, have mercy on
me!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:49}</span> Jesus stood still, and said, "Call him."</p>

<p>They called the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:50}</span> He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:51}</span> Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"</p>

<p>The blind man said to him, "Rabboni, that I may see again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:52}</span> Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your faith has made you
well." Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:1}</span> When they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethsphage and
Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <span class="verse">{11:2}</span>
and said to them, "Go your way into the village that is opposite you.
Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on
which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him. <span class="verse">{11:3}</span> If anyone asks
you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord needs him;' and
immediately he will send him back here."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:4}</span> They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door
outside in the open street, and they untied him. <span class="verse">{11:5}</span> Some of those
who stood there asked them, "What are you doing, untying the young
donkey?" <span class="verse">{11:6}</span> They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let
them go.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:7}</span> They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their
garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. <span class="verse">{11:8}</span> Many spread their garments
on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and
spreading them on the road. <span class="verse">{11:9}</span> Those who went in front, and those
who followed, cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord! <span class="verse">{11:10}</span> Blessed is the kingdom of our father
David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:11}</span> Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had
looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to
Bethany with the twelve.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:12}</span> The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was
hungry. <span class="verse">{11:13}</span> Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to
see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he
found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <span class="verse">{11:14}</span>
Jesus told it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" and his
disciples heard it.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:15}</span> They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple,
and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the
temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats
of those who sold the doves. <span class="verse">{11:16}</span> He would not allow anyone to carry
a container through the temple. <span class="verse">{11:17}</span> He taught, saying to them,
"Isn't it written, 'My house will be called a house of prayer for all
the nations?' But you have made it a den of robbers!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:18}</span> The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how
they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude
was astonished at his teaching.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:19}</span> When evening came, he went out of the city. <span class="verse">{11:20}</span> As they
passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the
roots. <span class="verse">{11:21}</span> Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig
tree which you cursed has withered away."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:22}</span> Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God. <span class="verse">{11:23}</span> For most
certainly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, 'Be taken up and
cast into the sea,' and doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes that
what he says is happening; he shall have whatever he says. <span class="verse">{11:24}</span>
Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe
that you have received them, and you shall have them. <span class="verse">{11:25}</span> Whenever
you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so
that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your
transgressions. <span class="verse">{11:26}</span> But if you do not forgive, neither will your
Father in heaven forgive your transgressions."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:27}</span> They came again to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the
temple, the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders came to him,
<span class="verse">{11:28}</span> and they began saying to him, "By what authority do you do
these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:29}</span> Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. Answer me,
and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. <span class="verse">{11:30}</span> The
baptism of John--was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:31}</span> They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we should say,
'From heaven;' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' <span class="verse">{11:32}</span>
If we should say, 'From men'"--they feared the people, for all held
John to really be a prophet. <span class="verse">{11:33}</span> They answered Jesus, "We don't
know."</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do
these things."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:1}</span> He began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a
vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a
tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country. <span class="verse">{12:2}</span>
When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the
farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard. <span class="verse">{12:3}</span> They took him,
beat him, and sent him away empty. <span class="verse">{12:4}</span> Again, he sent another
servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head,
and sent him away shamefully treated. <span class="verse">{12:5}</span> Again he sent another; and
they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.
<span class="verse">{12:6}</span> Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to
them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' <span class="verse">{12:7}</span> But those farmers said
among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.' <span class="verse">{12:8}</span> They took him, killed him, and cast
him out of the vineyard. <span class="verse">{12:9}</span> What therefore will the lord of the
vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others. <span class="verse">{12:10}</span> Haven't you even read this Scripture:
'The stone which the builders rejected,
   the same was made the head of the corner.
<span class="verse">{12:11}</span> This was from the Lord,
   it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:12}</span> They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for
they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him,
and went away. <span class="verse">{12:13}</span> They sent some of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <span class="verse">{12:14}</span> When
they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest,
and don't defer to anyone; for you aren't partial to anyone, but truly
teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
<span class="verse">{12:15}</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give?"</p>

<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me?
Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:16}</span> They brought it.</p>

<p>He said to them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "Caesar's."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:17}</span> Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</p>

<p>They marveled greatly at him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:18}</span> There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no
resurrection. They asked him, saying, <span class="verse">{12:19}</span> "Teacher, Moses wrote to
us, 'If a man's brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves
no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
offspring for his brother.' <span class="verse">{12:20}</span> There were seven brothers. The
first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <span class="verse">{12:21}</span> The second took
her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;
<span class="verse">{12:22}</span> and the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the
woman also died. <span class="verse">{12:23}</span> In the resurrection, when they rise, whose
wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:24}</span> Jesus answered them, "Isn't this because you are mistaken,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? <span class="verse">{12:25}</span> For when they
will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
but are like angels in heaven. <span class="verse">{12:26}</span> But about the dead, that they
are raised; haven't you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how
God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob'? <span class="verse">{12:27}</span> He is not the God of the dead, but
of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:28}</span> One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning
together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which
commandment is the greatest of all?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:29}</span> Jesus answered, "The greatest is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord
our God, the Lord is one: <span class="verse">{12:30}</span> you shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and
with all your strength.' This is the first commandment. <span class="verse">{12:31}</span> The
second is like this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
There is no other commandment greater than these."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:32}</span> The scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well
that he is one, and there is none other but he, <span class="verse">{12:33}</span> and to love him
with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul,
and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more
important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:34}</span> When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You
are not far from the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p>No one dared ask him any question after that. <span class="verse">{12:35}</span> Jesus
responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say
that the Christ is the son of David? <span class="verse">{12:36}</span> For David himself said in
the Holy Spirit,
'The Lord said to my Lord,
   "Sit at my right hand,
   until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:37}</span> Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his
son?"</p>

<p>The common people heard him gladly. <span class="verse">{12:38}</span> In his teaching he said
to them, "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to
get greetings in the marketplaces, <span class="verse">{12:39}</span> and the best seats in the
synagogues, and the best places at feasts: <span class="verse">{12:40}</span> those who devour
widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will
receive greater condemnation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:41}</span> Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the
multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in
much. <span class="verse">{12:42}</span> A poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass
coins, which equal a quadrans coin. <span class="verse">{12:43}</span> He called
his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most certainly I tell you,
this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the
treasury, <span class="verse">{12:44}</span> for they all gave out of their abundance, but she,
out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:1}</span> As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to
him, "Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:2}</span> Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There
will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown
down."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:3}</span> As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter,
James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, <span class="verse">{13:4}</span> "Tell us, when will
these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be
fulfilled?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:5}</span> Jesus, answering, began to tell them, "Be careful that no one
leads you astray. <span class="verse">{13:6}</span> For many will come in my name, saying, 'I
am he!' and will lead many astray.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:7}</span> "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled.
For those must happen, but the end is not yet. <span class="verse">{13:8}</span> For nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles.
These things are the beginning of birth pains. <span class="verse">{13:9}</span> But watch
yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be
beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my
sake, for a testimony to them. <span class="verse">{13:10}</span> The Good News must first be
preached to all the nations. <span class="verse">{13:11}</span> When they lead you away and
deliver you up, don't be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you
will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is
not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:12}</span> "Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father
his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be
put to death. <span class="verse">{13:13}</span> You will be hated by all men for my name's sake,
but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved. <span class="verse">{13:14}</span> But when
you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the
prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then
let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, <span class="verse">{13:15}</span> and let him
who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out
of his house. <span class="verse">{13:16}</span> Let him who is in the field not return back to
take his cloak. <span class="verse">{13:17}</span> But woe to those who are with child and to
those who nurse babies in those days! <span class="verse">{13:18}</span> Pray that your flight
won't be in the winter. <span class="verse">{13:19}</span> For in those days there will be
oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of
the creation which God created until now, and never will be. <span class="verse">{13:20}</span>
Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved;
but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened
the days. <span class="verse">{13:21}</span> Then if anyone tells you, 'Look, here is the Christ!'
or, 'Look, there!' don't believe it. <span class="verse">{13:22}</span> For there will arise false
christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they
may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones. <span class="verse">{13:23}</span> But you
watch.</p>

<p>"Behold, I have told you all things beforehand. <span class="verse">{13:24}</span> But in those
days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will
not give its light, <span class="verse">{13:25}</span> the stars will be falling from the sky, and
the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. <span class="verse">{13:26}</span> Then
they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and
glory. <span class="verse">{13:27}</span> Then he will send out his angels, and will gather
together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the
earth to the ends of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:28}</span> "Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch
has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the
summer is near; <span class="verse">{13:29}</span> even so you also, when you see these things
coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors. <span class="verse">{13:30}</span> Most
certainly I say to you, this generation will not pass away
until all these things happen. <span class="verse">{13:31}</span> Heaven and earth will pass away,
but my words will not pass away. <span class="verse">{13:32}</span> But of that day or that hour
no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father. <span class="verse">{13:33}</span> Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don't know when
the time is.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:34}</span> "It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left
his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his
work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch. <span class="verse">{13:35}</span> Watch
therefore, for you don't know when the lord of the house is coming,
whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in
the morning; <span class="verse">{13:36}</span> lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.
<span class="verse">{13:37}</span> What I tell you, I tell all: Watch."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:1}</span> It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the
unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they
might seize him by deception, and kill him. <span class="verse">{14:2}</span> For they said, "Not
during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:3}</span> While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as
he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment
of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his
head. <span class="verse">{14:4}</span> But there were some who were indignant among themselves,
saying, "Why has this ointment been wasted? <span class="verse">{14:5}</span> For this might have
been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to
the poor." They grumbled against her.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:6}</span> But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She
has done a good work for me. <span class="verse">{14:7}</span> For you always have the poor with
you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not
always have me. <span class="verse">{14:8}</span> She has done what she could. She has anointed my
body beforehand for the burying. <span class="verse">{14:9}</span> Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world,
that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of
her."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:10}</span> Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the
chief priests, that he might deliver him to them. <span class="verse">{14:11}</span> They, when
they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how
he might conveniently deliver him. <span class="verse">{14:12}</span> On the first day of
unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples
asked him, "Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the
Passover?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:13}</span> He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the
city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow
him, <span class="verse">{14:14}</span> and wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house,
'The Teacher says, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?"' <span class="verse">{14:15}</span> He will himself show you a large
upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:16}</span> His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found
things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:17}</span> When it was evening he came with the twelve. <span class="verse">{14:18}</span> As they
sat and were eating, Jesus said, "Most certainly I tell you, one of you
will betray me--he who eats with me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:19}</span> They began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one,
"Surely not I?" And another said, "Surely not I?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:20}</span> He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, he who dips with
me in the dish. <span class="verse">{14:21}</span> For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written
about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would be better for that man if he had not been born."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:22}</span> As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had
blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, "Take, eat. This is
my body."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:23}</span> He took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to
them. They all drank of it. <span class="verse">{14:24}</span> He said to them, "This is my blood
of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. <span class="verse">{14:25}</span> Most
certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine,
until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God." <span class="verse">{14:26}</span>
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:27}</span> Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble
because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd,
and the sheep will be scattered.' <span class="verse">{14:28}</span> However, after I am
raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:29}</span> But Peter said to him, "Although all will be offended, yet I
will not."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:30}</span> Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you, that you
today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny
me three times."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:31}</span> But he spoke all the more, "If I must die with you, I will
not deny you." They all said the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:32}</span> They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to
his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray." <span class="verse">{14:33}</span> He took with him
Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and
distressed. <span class="verse">{14:34}</span> He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,
even to death. Stay here, and watch."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:35}</span> He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. <span class="verse">{14:36}</span>
He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove
this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:37}</span> He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon,
are you sleeping? Couldn't you watch one hour? <span class="verse">{14:38}</span> Watch and pray,
that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing,
but the flesh is weak."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:39}</span> Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
<span class="verse">{14:40}</span> Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were
very heavy, and they didn't know what to answer him. <span class="verse">{14:41}</span> He came
the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. It
is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into
the hands of sinners. <span class="verse">{14:42}</span> Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who
betrays me is at hand."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:43}</span> Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the
twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the
chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. <span class="verse">{14:44}</span> Now he who betrayed
him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I will kiss, that is he.
Seize him, and lead him away safely." <span class="verse">{14:45}</span> When he had come,
immediately he came to him, and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi!" and kissed him.
<span class="verse">{14:46}</span> They laid their hands on him, and seized him. <span class="verse">{14:47}</span> But a
certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:48}</span> Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a
robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? <span class="verse">{14:49}</span> I was daily with you
in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me. But this is so that
the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:50}</span> They all left him, and fled. <span class="verse">{14:51}</span> A certain young man
followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his
naked body. The young men grabbed him, <span class="verse">{14:52}</span> but he left the linen
cloth, and fled from them naked. <span class="verse">{14:53}</span> They led Jesus away to the
high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came
together with him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:54}</span> Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into
the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and
warming himself in the light of the fire. <span class="verse">{14:55}</span> Now the chief priests
and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to
death, and found none. <span class="verse">{14:56}</span> For many gave false testimony against
him, and their testimony didn't agree with each other. <span class="verse">{14:57}</span> Some
stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying, <span class="verse">{14:58}</span> "We
heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and
in three days I will build another made without hands.'" <span class="verse">{14:59}</span> Even
so, their testimony did not agree.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:60}</span> The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
"Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?"
<span class="verse">{14:61}</span> But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high
priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:62}</span> Jesus said, "I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at
the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:63}</span> The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further
need have we of witnesses? <span class="verse">{14:64}</span> You have heard the blasphemy! What
do you think?" They all condemned him to be worthy of death. <span class="verse">{14:65}</span>
Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with
fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the
palms of their hands.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:66}</span> As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the
high priest came, <span class="verse">{14:67}</span> and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked
at him, and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:68}</span> But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand
what you are saying." He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:69}</span> The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood
by, "This is one of them." <span class="verse">{14:70}</span> But he again denied it. After a
little while again those who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one
of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it." <span class="verse">{14:71}</span> But
he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man of whom you
speak!" <span class="verse">{14:72}</span> The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered
the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice,
you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:1}</span> Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders
and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound
Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. <span class="verse">{15:2}</span>
Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>He answered, "So you say."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:3}</span> The chief priests accused him of many things. <span class="verse">{15:4}</span> Pilate
again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify
against you!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:5}</span> But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:6}</span> Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner,
whom they asked of him. <span class="verse">{15:7}</span> There was one called Barabbas, bound
with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had
committed murder. <span class="verse">{15:8}</span> The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him
to do as he always did for them. <span class="verse">{15:9}</span> Pilate answered them, saying,
"Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" <span class="verse">{15:10}</span> For he
perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <span class="verse">{15:11}</span>
But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release
Barabbas to them instead. <span class="verse">{15:12}</span> Pilate again asked them, "What then
should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:13}</span> They cried out again, "Crucify him!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:14}</span> Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"</p>

<p>But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:15}</span> Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas
to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be
crucified. <span class="verse">{15:16}</span> The soldiers led him away within the court, which is
the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort. <span class="verse">{15:17}</span> They
clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on
him. <span class="verse">{15:18}</span> They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
<span class="verse">{15:19}</span> They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing
their knees, did homage to him. <span class="verse">{15:20}</span> When they had mocked him, they
took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led
him out to crucify him. <span class="verse">{15:21}</span> They compelled one passing by, coming
from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus,
to go with them, that he might bear his cross. <span class="verse">{15:22}</span> They brought him
to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place
of a skull." <span class="verse">{15:23}</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink,
but he didn't take it.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:24}</span> Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting
lots on them, what each should take. <span class="verse">{15:25}</span> It was the third
hour, and they crucified him. <span class="verse">{15:26}</span> The superscription of his
accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS." <span class="verse">{15:27}</span> With
him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his
left. <span class="verse">{15:28}</span> The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was
numbered with transgressors."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:29}</span> Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and
saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,
<span class="verse">{15:30}</span> save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:31}</span> Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves
with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can't save himself. <span class="verse">{15:32}</span>
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that
we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with
him insulted him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:33}</span> When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness
over the whole land until the ninth hour. <span class="verse">{15:34}</span> At the
ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have
you forsaken me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:35}</span> Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said,
"Behold, he is calling Elijah."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:36}</span> One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a
reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let's see
whether Elijah comes to take him down."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:37}</span> Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.
<span class="verse">{15:38}</span> The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the
bottom. <span class="verse">{15:39}</span> When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that
he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man
was the Son of God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:40}</span> There were also women watching from afar, among whom were
both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of
Joses, and Salome; <span class="verse">{15:41}</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him,
and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:42}</span> When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation
Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <span class="verse">{15:43}</span> Joseph of Arimathaea,
a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom
of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
<span class="verse">{15:44}</span> Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the
centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long. <span class="verse">{15:45}</span> When he
found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <span class="verse">{15:46}</span> He
bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen
cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He
rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. <span class="verse">{15:47}</span> Mary Magdalene and
Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:1}</span> When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and
anoint him. <span class="verse">{16:2}</span> Very early on the first day of the week, they came
to the tomb when the sun had risen. <span class="verse">{16:3}</span> They were saying among
themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for
us?" <span class="verse">{16:4}</span> for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone
was rolled back.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:5}</span> Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the
right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. <span class="verse">{16:6}</span> He
said to them, "Don't be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has
been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where
they laid him! <span class="verse">{16:7}</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes
before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:8}</span> They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and
astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they
were afraid. <span class="verse">{16:9}</span> Now when he had risen early on the first day of the
week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out
seven demons. <span class="verse">{16:10}</span> She went and told those who had been with him, as
they mourned and wept. <span class="verse">{16:11}</span> When they heard that he was alive, and
had been seen by her, they disbelieved. <span class="verse">{16:12}</span> After these things he
was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their
way into the country. <span class="verse">{16:13}</span> They went away and told it to the rest.
They didn't believe them, either.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:14}</span> Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they
sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness
of heart, because they didn't believe those who had seen him after he
had risen. <span class="verse">{16:15}</span> He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach
the Good News to the whole creation. <span class="verse">{16:16}</span> He who believes and is
baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
<span class="verse">{16:17}</span> These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they
will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages; <span class="verse">{16:18}</span> they
will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in
no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will
recover."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:19}</span> So then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was
received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God. <span class="verse">{16:20}</span>
They went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and
confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</p>


<h2>Luke</h2>

<p><span class="verse">{1:1}</span> Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative
concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us, <span class="verse">{1:2}</span> even
as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the
word delivered them to us, <span class="verse">{1:3}</span> it seemed good to me also, having
traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to
you in order, most excellent Theophilus; <span class="verse">{1:4}</span> that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:5}</span> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a
wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <span class="verse">{1:6}</span> They
were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <span class="verse">{1:7}</span> But they had no child,
because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years. <span class="verse">{1:8}</span> Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office
before God in the order of his division, <span class="verse">{1:9}</span> according to the custom
of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the
Lord and burn incense. <span class="verse">{1:10}</span> The whole multitude of the people were
praying outside at the hour of incense.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:11}</span> An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
side of the altar of incense. <span class="verse">{1:12}</span> Zacharias was troubled when he saw
him, and fear fell upon him. <span class="verse">{1:13}</span> But the angel said to him, "Don't
be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your
wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
<span class="verse">{1:14}</span> You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his
birth. <span class="verse">{1:15}</span> For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he
will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy
Spirit, even from his mother's womb. <span class="verse">{1:16}</span> He will turn many of the
children of Israel to the Lord, their God. <span class="verse">{1:17}</span> He will go before him
in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to
prepare a people prepared for the Lord."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:18}</span> Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For
I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:19}</span> The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the
presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good
news. <span class="verse">{1:20}</span> Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until
the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my
words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:21}</span> The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that
he delayed in the temple. <span class="verse">{1:22}</span> When he came out, he could not speak
to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He
continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <span class="verse">{1:23}</span> It happened,
when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
<span class="verse">{1:24}</span> After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid
herself five months, saying, <span class="verse">{1:25}</span> "Thus has the Lord done to me in
the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:26}</span> Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <span class="verse">{1:27}</span> to a virgin pledged to be
married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The
virgin's name was Mary. <span class="verse">{1:28}</span> Having come in, the angel said to her,
"Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you
among women!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:29}</span> But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying,
and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <span class="verse">{1:30}</span> The angel
said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
<span class="verse">{1:31}</span> Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son,
and will call his name 'Jesus.' <span class="verse">{1:32}</span> He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne
of his father, David, <span class="verse">{1:33}</span> and he will reign over the house of Jacob
forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:34}</span> Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a
virgin?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:35}</span> The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the
holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. <span class="verse">{1:36}</span>
Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old
age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. <span class="verse">{1:37}</span>
For everything spoken by God is possible."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:38}</span> Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
according to your word."</p>

<p>The angel departed from her. <span class="verse">{1:39}</span> Mary arose in those days and
went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <span class="verse">{1:40}</span> and
entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <span class="verse">{1:41}</span> It
happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in
her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse">{1:42}</span> She
called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <span class="verse">{1:43}</span> Why am I so favored, that
the mother of my Lord should come to me? <span class="verse">{1:44}</span> For behold, when the
voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb
for joy! <span class="verse">{1:45}</span> Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a
fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:46}</span> Mary said,
"My soul magnifies the Lord.
   <span class="verse">{1:47}</span> My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
   <span class="verse">{1:48}</span> for he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.
For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
   <span class="verse">{1:49}</span> For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
   Holy is his name.
   <span class="verse">{1:50}</span> His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear
      him.
<span class="verse">{1:51}</span> He has shown strength with his arm.
   He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
<span class="verse">{1:52}</span> He has put down princes from their thrones.
   And has exalted the lowly.
<span class="verse">{1:53}</span> He has filled the hungry with good things.
   He has sent the rich away empty.
<span class="verse">{1:54}</span> He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember
      mercy,
   <span class="verse">{1:55}</span> As he spoke to our fathers,
   to Abraham and his seed forever."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:56}</span> Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to
her house. <span class="verse">{1:57}</span> Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was
fulfilled, and she brought forth a son. <span class="verse">{1:58}</span> Her neighbors and her
relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and
they rejoiced with her. <span class="verse">{1:59}</span> It happened on the eighth day, that they
came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
after the name of the father. <span class="verse">{1:60}</span> His mother answered, "Not so; but
he will be called John."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:61}</span> They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who
is called by this name." <span class="verse">{1:62}</span> They made signs to his father, what he
would have him called.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:63}</span> He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."</p>

<p>They all marveled. <span class="verse">{1:64}</span> His mouth was opened immediately, and his
tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. <span class="verse">{1:65}</span> Fear came on all who
lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout
all the hill country of Judea. <span class="verse">{1:66}</span> All who heard them laid them up
in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the
Lord was with him. <span class="verse">{1:67}</span> His father, Zacharias, was filled with the
Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<span class="verse">{1:68}</span> "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
   for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
<span class="verse">{1:69}</span> and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his
      servant David
   <span class="verse">{1:70}</span> (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been
      from of old),
   <span class="verse">{1:71}</span> salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate
      us;
<span class="verse">{1:72}</span> to show mercy towards our fathers,
   to remember his holy covenant,
<span class="verse">{1:73}</span> the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,
   <span class="verse">{1:74}</span> to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of
      our enemies,
   should serve him without fear,
   <span class="verse">{1:75}</span> In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
      life.
<span class="verse">{1:76}</span> And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,
   for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
   <span class="verse">{1:77}</span> to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission
      of their sins,
<span class="verse">{1:78}</span> because of the tender mercy of our God,
   whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
   <span class="verse">{1:79}</span> to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
   to guide our feet into the way of peace."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:80}</span> The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was
in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:1}</span> Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from
Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. <span class="verse">{2:2}</span> This was
the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. <span class="verse">{2:3}</span>
All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. <span class="verse">{2:4}</span> Joseph
also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to
the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the
house and family of David; <span class="verse">{2:5}</span> to enroll himself with Mary, who was
pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:6}</span> It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that
she should give birth. <span class="verse">{2:7}</span> She brought forth her firstborn son, and
she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough,
because there was no room for them in the inn. <span class="verse">{2:8}</span> There were
shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch
by night over their flock. <span class="verse">{2:9}</span> Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were
terrified. <span class="verse">{2:10}</span> The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for behold,
I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
<span class="verse">{2:11}</span> For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <span class="verse">{2:12}</span> This is the sign to you: you
will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding
trough." <span class="verse">{2:13}</span> Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly army praising God, and saying,
<span class="verse">{2:14}</span> "Glory to God in the highest,
   on earth peace, good will toward men."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:15}</span> It happened, when the angels went away from them into the
sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's go to Bethlehem,
now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made
known to us." <span class="verse">{2:16}</span> They came with haste, and found both Mary and
Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough. <span class="verse">{2:17}</span> When they
saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them
about this child. <span class="verse">{2:18}</span> All who heard it wondered at the things which
were spoken to them by the shepherds. <span class="verse">{2:19}</span> But Mary kept all these
sayings, pondering them in her heart. <span class="verse">{2:20}</span> The shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and
seen, just as it was told them.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:21}</span> When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the
child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before
he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:22}</span> When the days of their purification according to the law of
Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him
to the Lord <span class="verse">{2:23}</span> (as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every
male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord"), <span class="verse">{2:24}</span>
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of
the Lord, "A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:25}</span> Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.
This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of
Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. <span class="verse">{2:26}</span> It had been revealed to
him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen
the Lord's Christ. <span class="verse">{2:27}</span> He came in the Spirit into the
temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might
do concerning him according to the custom of the law, <span class="verse">{2:28}</span> then he
received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
<span class="verse">{2:29}</span> "Now you are releasing your servant, Master,
   according to your word, in peace;
<span class="verse">{2:30}</span> for my eyes have seen your salvation,
   <span class="verse">{2:31}</span> which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
<span class="verse">{2:32}</span> a light for revelation to the nations,
   and the glory of your people Israel."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:33}</span> Joseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were
spoken concerning him, <span class="verse">{2:34}</span> and Simeon blessed them, and said to
Mary, his mother, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the
rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.
<span class="verse">{2:35}</span> Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the
thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:36}</span> There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband
seven years from her virginity, <span class="verse">{2:37}</span> and she had been a widow for
about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple,
worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. <span class="verse">{2:38}</span> Coming up
at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all
those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:39}</span> When they had accomplished all things that were according to
the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city,
Nazareth. <span class="verse">{2:40}</span> The child was growing, and was becoming strong in
spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
<span class="verse">{2:41}</span> His parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the
Passover.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:42}</span> When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
according to the custom of the feast, <span class="verse">{2:43}</span> and when they had
fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind
in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it, <span class="verse">{2:44}</span> but
supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they
looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances. <span class="verse">{2:45}</span> When
they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.
<span class="verse">{2:46}</span> It happened after three days they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and
asking them questions. <span class="verse">{2:47}</span> All who heard him were amazed at his
understanding and his answers. <span class="verse">{2:48}</span> When they saw him, they were
astonished, and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us
this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:49}</span> He said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you
know that I must be in my Father's house?" <span class="verse">{2:50}</span> They didn't
understand the saying which he spoke to them. <span class="verse">{2:51}</span> And he went down
with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother
kept all these sayings in her heart. <span class="verse">{2:52}</span> And Jesus increased in
wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:1}</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of
Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and
Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, <span class="verse">{3:2}</span> in the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son
of Zacharias, in the wilderness. <span class="verse">{3:3}</span> He came into all the region
around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of
sins. <span class="verse">{3:4}</span> As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
prophet,
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
   'Make ready the way of the Lord.
Make his paths straight.
   <span class="verse">{3:5}</span> Every valley will be filled.
Every mountain and hill will be brought low.
   The crooked will become straight,
   and the rough ways smooth.
<span class="verse">{3:6}</span> All flesh will see God's salvation.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:7}</span> He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be
baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from
the wrath to come? <span class="verse">{3:8}</span> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham
for our father;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children
to Abraham from these stones! <span class="verse">{3:9}</span> Even now the axe also lies at the
root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good
fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:10}</span> The multitudes asked him, "What then must we do?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:11}</span> He answered them, "He who has two coats, let him give to him
who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:12}</span> Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to
him, "Teacher, what must we do?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:13}</span> He said to them, "Collect no more than that which is
appointed to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:14}</span> Soldiers also asked him, saying, "What about us? What must we
do?"</p>

<p>He said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:15}</span> As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in
their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, <span class="verse">{3:16}</span>
John answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes
who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to
loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire, <span class="verse">{3:17}</span> whose
fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor,
and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff
with unquenchable fire."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:18}</span> Then with many other exhortations he preached good news to
the people, <span class="verse">{3:19}</span> but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for
Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things which
Herod had done, <span class="verse">{3:20}</span> added this also to them all, that he shut up
John in prison. <span class="verse">{3:21}</span> Now it happened, when all the people were
baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was
opened, <span class="verse">{3:22}</span> and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove
on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are my beloved
Son. In you I am well pleased."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:23}</span> Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years
old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, <span class="verse">{3:24}</span>
the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of
Jannai, the son of Joseph, <span class="verse">{3:25}</span> the son of Mattathias, the son of
Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, <span class="verse">{3:26}</span> the
son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of
Joseph, the son of Judah, <span class="verse">{3:27}</span> the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa,
the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri, <span class="verse">{3:28}</span>
the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of
Elmodam, the son of Er, <span class="verse">{3:29}</span> the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the
son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, <span class="verse">{3:30}</span> the son of
Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son
of Eliakim, <span class="verse">{3:31}</span> the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of
Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David, <span class="verse">{3:32}</span> the son of Jesse,
the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of
Nahshon, <span class="verse">{3:33}</span> the son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son
of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, <span class="verse">{3:34}</span> the son of Jacob,
the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of
Nahor, <span class="verse">{3:35}</span> the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the
son of Eber, the son of Shelah, <span class="verse">{3:36}</span> the son of Cainan, the son of
Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, <span class="verse">{3:37}</span>
the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of
Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, <span class="verse">{3:38}</span> the son of Enos, the son of Seth,
the son of Adam, the son of God.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:1}</span> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness <span class="verse">{4:2}</span> for forty days, being
tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when
they were completed, he was hungry. <span class="verse">{4:3}</span> The devil said to him, "If
you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:4}</span> Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:5}</span> The devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all
the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. <span class="verse">{4:6}</span> The devil said to
him, "I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has
been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want. <span class="verse">{4:7}</span> If you
therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:8}</span> Jesus answered him, "Get behind me Satan! For it is written,
'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:9}</span> He led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the
temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down
from here, <span class="verse">{4:10}</span> for it is written,
'He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:11}</span> and,
'On their hands they will bear you up,
   lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:12}</span> Jesus answering, said to him, "It has been said, 'You shall
not tempt the Lord your God.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:13}</span> When the devil had completed every temptation, he departed
from him until another time.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:14}</span> Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and
news about him spread through all the surrounding area. <span class="verse">{4:15}</span> He
taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:16}</span> He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He
entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and
stood up to read. <span class="verse">{4:17}</span> The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to
him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
<span class="verse">{4:18}</span> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
   because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
   to proclaim release to the captives,
   recovering of sight to the blind,
   to deliver those who are crushed,
   <span class="verse">{4:19}</span> and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:20}</span> He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat
down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him. <span class="verse">{4:21}</span> He
began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your
hearing."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:22}</span> All testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, "Isn't this Joseph's
son?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:23}</span> He said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable,
'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do
also here in your hometown.'" <span class="verse">{4:24}</span> He said, "Most certainly I tell
you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. <span class="verse">{4:25}</span> But truly I tell
you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the
sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came
over all the land. <span class="verse">{4:26}</span> Elijah was sent to none of them, except to
Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. <span class="verse">{4:27}</span>
There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet
not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:28}</span> They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they
heard these things. <span class="verse">{4:29}</span> They rose up, threw him out of the city, and
led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they
might throw him off the cliff. <span class="verse">{4:30}</span> But he, passing through their
midst, went his way.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:31}</span> He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching
them on the Sabbath day, <span class="verse">{4:32}</span> and they were astonished at his
teaching, for his word was with authority. <span class="verse">{4:33}</span> In the synagogue
there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out
with a loud voice, <span class="verse">{4:34}</span> saying, "Ah! what have we to do with you,
Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are:
the Holy One of God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:35}</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
When the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him,
having done him no harm.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:36}</span> Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with
another, saying, "What is this word? For with authority and power he
commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!" <span class="verse">{4:37}</span> News about him
went out into every place of the surrounding region.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:38}</span> He rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
house. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they
begged him for her. <span class="verse">{4:39}</span> He stood over her, and rebuked the fever;
and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. <span class="verse">{4:40}</span> When
the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases
brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and
healed them. <span class="verse">{4:41}</span> Demons also came out from many, crying out, and
saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" Rebuking them, he didn't
allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:42}</span> When it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited
place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on
to him, so that he wouldn't go away from them. <span class="verse">{4:43}</span> But he said to
them, "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other
cities also. For this reason I have been sent." <span class="verse">{4:44}</span> He was preaching
in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:1}</span> Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard
the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. <span class="verse">{5:2}</span>
He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out
of them, and were washing their nets. <span class="verse">{5:3}</span> He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the
land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <span class="verse">{5:4}</span> When
he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the deep, and
let down your nets for a catch."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:5}</span> Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took
nothing; but at your word I will let down the net." <span class="verse">{5:6}</span> When they had
done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was
breaking. <span class="verse">{5:7}</span> They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that
they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so
that they began to sink. <span class="verse">{5:8}</span> But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell
down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man,
Lord." <span class="verse">{5:9}</span> For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch
of fish which they had caught; <span class="verse">{5:10}</span> and so also were James and John,
sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.</p>

<p>Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will be
catching people alive."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:11}</span> When they had brought their boats to land, they left
everything, and followed him. <span class="verse">{5:12}</span> It happened, while he was in one
of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw
Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you want
to, you can make me clean."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:13}</span> He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want
to. Be made clean."</p>

<p>Immediately the leprosy left him. <span class="verse">{5:14}</span> He commanded him to tell no
one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for
your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to
them." <span class="verse">{5:15}</span> But the report concerning him spread much more, and great
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
infirmities. <span class="verse">{5:16}</span> But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:17}</span> It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and
there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come
out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the
Lord was with him to heal them. <span class="verse">{5:18}</span> Behold, men brought a paralyzed
man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.
<span class="verse">{5:19}</span> Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they
went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his
cot into the midst before Jesus. <span class="verse">{5:20}</span> Seeing their faith, he said to
him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:21}</span> The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who
is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:22}</span> But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are
you reasoning so in your hearts? <span class="verse">{5:23}</span> Which is easier to say, 'Your
sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?' <span class="verse">{5:24}</span> But that
you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive
sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up
your cot, and go to your house."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:25}</span> Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he
was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <span class="verse">{5:26}</span>
Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled
with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:27}</span> After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named
Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, "Follow me!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:28}</span> He left everything, and rose up and followed him. <span class="verse">{5:29}</span> Levi
made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax
collectors and others who were reclining with them. <span class="verse">{5:30}</span> Their
scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why
do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?" <span class="verse">{5:31}</span> Jesus
answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but
those who are sick do. <span class="verse">{5:32}</span> I have not come to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:33}</span> They said to him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and
pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and
drink?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:34}</span> He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom
fast, while the bridegroom is with them? <span class="verse">{5:35}</span> But the days will come
when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast
in those days." <span class="verse">{5:36}</span> He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a
piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the
new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. <span class="verse">{5:37}</span> No
one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst
the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
<span class="verse">{5:38}</span> But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are
preserved. <span class="verse">{5:39}</span> No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new,
for he says, 'The old is better.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:1}</span> Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he
was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of
grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands. <span class="verse">{6:2}</span> But some of the
Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do
on the Sabbath day?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:3}</span> Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you read what David did
when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; <span class="verse">{6:4}</span> how he
entered into God's house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave
also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for
the priests alone?" <span class="verse">{6:5}</span> He said to them, "The Son of Man is lord of
the Sabbath."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:6}</span> It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the
synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was
withered. <span class="verse">{6:7}</span> The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see
whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an
accusation against him. <span class="verse">{6:8}</span> But he knew their thoughts; and he said
to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the
middle." He arose and stood. <span class="verse">{6:9}</span> Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask
you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm?
To save a life, or to kill?" <span class="verse">{6:10}</span> He looked around at them all, and
said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was
restored as sound as the other. <span class="verse">{6:11}</span> But they were filled with rage,
and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:12}</span> It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain
to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. <span class="verse">{6:13}</span> When it
was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom
he also named apostles: <span class="verse">{6:14}</span> Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew,
his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <span class="verse">{6:15}</span> Matthew; Thomas;
James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; <span class="verse">{6:16}</span>
Judas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.
<span class="verse">{6:17}</span> He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd
of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and
Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him
and to be healed of their diseases; <span class="verse">{6:18}</span> as well as those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <span class="verse">{6:19}</span> All the
multitude sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed
them all.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:20}</span> He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,
"Blessed are you who are poor,
   for yours is the Kingdom of God.
<span class="verse">{6:21}</span> Blessed are you who hunger now,
   for you will be filled.
Blessed are you who weep now,
   for you will laugh.
<span class="verse">{6:22}</span> Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall
      exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the
      Son of Man's sake.
   <span class="verse">{6:23}</span> Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your
      reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing
      to the prophets.

<span class="verse">{6:24}</span> "But woe to you who are rich!
   For you have received your consolation.
<span class="verse">{6:25}</span> Woe to you, you who are full now,
   for you will be hungry.
Woe to you who laugh now,
   for you will mourn and weep.
<span class="verse">{6:26}</span> Woe, when men speak well of you,
   for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:27}</span> "But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those
who hate you, <span class="verse">{6:28}</span> bless those who curse you, and pray for those who
mistreat you. <span class="verse">{6:29}</span> To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also
the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don't withhold your
coat also. <span class="verse">{6:30}</span> Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask him who
takes away your goods to give them back again.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:31}</span> "As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to
them. <span class="verse">{6:32}</span> If you love those who love you, what credit is that to
you? For even sinners love those who love them. <span class="verse">{6:33}</span> If you do good
to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even
sinners do the same. <span class="verse">{6:34}</span> If you lend to those from whom you hope to
receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to
receive back as much. <span class="verse">{6:35}</span> But love your enemies, and do good, and
lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you
will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful
and evil.
<span class="verse">{6:36}</span> Therefore be merciful,
   even as your Father is also merciful.
<span class="verse">{6:37}</span> Don't judge,
   and you won't be judged.
Don't condemn,
   and you won't be condemned.
Set free,
   and you will be set free.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:38}</span> "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed
down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to
you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured
back to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:39}</span> He spoke a parable to them. "Can the blind guide the blind?
Won't they both fall into a pit? <span class="verse">{6:40}</span> A disciple is not above his
teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his
teacher. <span class="verse">{6:41}</span> Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your
brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
<span class="verse">{6:42}</span> Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the
speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the
beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from
your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff
that is in your brother's eye. <span class="verse">{6:43}</span> For there is no good tree that
brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth
good fruit. <span class="verse">{6:44}</span> For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people
don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble
bush. <span class="verse">{6:45}</span> The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings
out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of
his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of
the heart, his mouth speaks.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:46}</span> "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and don't do the things
which I say? <span class="verse">{6:47}</span> Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and
does them, I will show you who he is like. <span class="verse">{6:48}</span> He is like a man
building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the
rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and
could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock. <span class="verse">{6:49}</span> But he
who hears, and doesn't do, is like a man who built a house on the earth
without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately
it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:1}</span> After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people,
he entered into Capernaum. <span class="verse">{7:2}</span> A certain centurion's servant, who was
dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. <span class="verse">{7:3}</span> When he heard
about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and
save his servant. <span class="verse">{7:4}</span> When they came to Jesus, they begged him
earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this for him, <span class="verse">{7:5}</span> for
he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us." <span class="verse">{7:6}</span> Jesus
went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion
sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for
I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. <span class="verse">{7:7}</span> Therefore I didn't
even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my
servant will be healed. <span class="verse">{7:8}</span> For I also am a man placed under
authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and he
goes; and to another, 'Come!' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do
this,' and he does it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:9}</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned
and said to the multitude who followed him, "I tell you, I have not
found such great faith, no, not in Israel." <span class="verse">{7:10}</span> Those who were sent,
returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was
well.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:11}</span> It happened soon afterwards, that he went to a city called
Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with
him. <span class="verse">{7:12}</span> Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one
who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. Many people of the city were with her. <span class="verse">{7:13}</span> When the Lord saw
her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "Don't cry." <span class="verse">{7:14}</span> He
came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said,
"Young man, I tell you, arise!" <span class="verse">{7:15}</span> He who was dead sat up, and
began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:16}</span> Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A
great prophet has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited his people!"
<span class="verse">{7:17}</span> This report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and
in all the surrounding region.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:18}</span> The disciples of John told him about all these things. <span class="verse">{7:19}</span>
John, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus,
saying, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"
<span class="verse">{7:20}</span> When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptizer has
sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who comes, or should we look for
another?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:21}</span> In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil
spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight. <span class="verse">{7:22}</span> Jesus
answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and
heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have
good news preached to them. <span class="verse">{7:23}</span> Blessed is he who finds no occasion
for stumbling in me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:24}</span> When John's messengers had departed, he began to tell the
multitudes about John, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see?
A reed shaken by the wind? <span class="verse">{7:25}</span> But what did you go out to see? A man
clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and
live delicately, are in kings' courts. <span class="verse">{7:26}</span> But what did you go out
to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
<span class="verse">{7:27}</span> This is he of whom it is written,
'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
   who will prepare your way before you.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:28}</span> "For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is
not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in
the Kingdom of God is greater than he."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:29}</span> When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they
declared God to be just, having been baptized with John's baptism.
<span class="verse">{7:30}</span> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God,
not being baptized by him themselves.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:31}</span> "To what then will I liken the people of this generation?
What are they like? <span class="verse">{7:32}</span> They are like children who sit in the
marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you
didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.' <span class="verse">{7:33}</span> For John the
Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He
has a demon.' <span class="verse">{7:34}</span> The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and
you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax
collectors and sinners!' <span class="verse">{7:35}</span> Wisdom is justified by all her
children."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:36}</span> One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered
into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table. <span class="verse">{7:37}</span> Behold, a woman
in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in
the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment. <span class="verse">{7:38}</span>
Standing behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her
tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet,
and anointed them with the ointment. <span class="verse">{7:39}</span> Now when the Pharisee who
had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "This man, if he were a
prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who
touches him, that she is a sinner."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:40}</span> Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>He said, "Teacher, say on."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:41}</span> "A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred
denarii, and the other fifty. <span class="verse">{7:42}</span> When they couldn't pay, he forgave
them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:43}</span> Simon answered, "He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most."</p>

<p>He said to him, "You have judged correctly." <span class="verse">{7:44}</span> Turning to the
woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your
house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet
with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. <span class="verse">{7:45}</span> You
gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to
kiss my feet. <span class="verse">{7:46}</span> You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has
anointed my feet with ointment. <span class="verse">{7:47}</span> Therefore I tell you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, the same loves little." <span class="verse">{7:48}</span> He said to her, "Your sins are
forgiven."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:49}</span> Those who sat at the table with him began to say to
themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:50}</span> He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:1}</span> It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities
and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of
God. With him were the twelve, <span class="verse">{8:2}</span> and certain women who had been
healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene,
from whom seven demons had gone out; <span class="verse">{8:3}</span> and Joanna, the wife of
Chuzas, Herod's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served
them from their possessions. <span class="verse">{8:4}</span> When a great multitude
came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke
by a parable. <span class="verse">{8:5}</span> "The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed,
some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds
of the sky devoured it. <span class="verse">{8:6}</span> Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon
as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. <span class="verse">{8:7}</span> Other
fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. <span class="verse">{8:8}</span>
Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one
hundred times." As he said these things, he called out, "He who has
ears to hear, let him hear!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:9}</span> Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:10}</span> He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not
see, and hearing they may not understand.' <span class="verse">{8:11}</span> Now the parable
is this: The seed is the word of God. <span class="verse">{8:12}</span> Those along the road are
those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from
their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. <span class="verse">{8:13}</span> Those on
the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but
these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of
temptation. <span class="verse">{8:14}</span> That which fell among the thorns, these are those
who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares,
riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. <span class="verse">{8:15}</span>
That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart,
having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with
patience.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:16}</span> "No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container,
or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in
may see the light. <span class="verse">{8:17}</span> For nothing is hidden, that will not be
revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to
light. <span class="verse">{8:18}</span> Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to
him will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from him will be taken
away even that which he thinks he has."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:19}</span> His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come
near him for the crowd. <span class="verse">{8:20}</span> It was told him by some saying, "Your
mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:21}</span> But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are these
who hear the word of God, and do it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:22}</span> Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a
boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, "Let's go over to
the other side of the lake." So they launched out. <span class="verse">{8:23}</span> But as they
sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they
were taking on dangerous amounts of water. <span class="verse">{8:24}</span> They came to him, and
awoke him, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" He awoke, and
rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it
was calm. <span class="verse">{8:25}</span> He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being
afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that
he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?" <span class="verse">{8:26}</span>
They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:27}</span> When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who
had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live
in a house, but in the tombs. <span class="verse">{8:28}</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have
to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't
torment me!" <span class="verse">{8:29}</span> For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come
out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was
kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands
apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:30}</span> Jesus asked him, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him. <span class="verse">{8:31}</span> They
begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. <span class="verse">{8:32}</span>
Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and
they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He
allowed them. <span class="verse">{8:33}</span> The demons came out from the man, and entered into
the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and
were drowned. <span class="verse">{8:34}</span> When those who fed them saw what had happened,
they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:35}</span> People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus,
and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus'
feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <span class="verse">{8:36}</span> Those
who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was
healed. <span class="verse">{8:37}</span> All the people of the surrounding country of the
Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much
afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <span class="verse">{8:38}</span> But the man from
whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but
Jesus sent him away, saying, <span class="verse">{8:39}</span> "Return to your house, and declare
what great things God has done for you." He went his way, proclaiming
throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:40}</span> It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed
him, for they were all waiting for him. <span class="verse">{8:41}</span> Behold, there came a man
named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at
Jesus' feet, and begged him to come into his house, <span class="verse">{8:42}</span> for he had
an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as
he went, the multitudes pressed against him. <span class="verse">{8:43}</span> A woman who had a
flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on
physicians, and could not be healed by any, <span class="verse">{8:44}</span> came behind him, and
touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of
her blood stopped. <span class="verse">{8:45}</span> Jesus said, "Who touched me?"</p>

<p>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:46}</span> But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that
power has gone out of me." <span class="verse">{8:47}</span> When the woman saw that she was not
hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him
in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him,
and how she was healed immediately. <span class="verse">{8:48}</span> He said to her, "Daughter,
cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:49}</span> While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's
house came, saying to him, "Your daughter is dead. Don't trouble the
Teacher."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:50}</span> But Jesus hearing it, answered him, "Don't be afraid. Only
believe, and she will be healed."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:51}</span> When he came to the house, he didn't allow anyone to enter
in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.
<span class="verse">{8:52}</span> All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, "Don't weep. She
isn't dead, but sleeping."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:53}</span> They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. <span class="verse">{8:54}</span>
But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called,
saying, "Child, arise!" <span class="verse">{8:55}</span> Her spirit returned, and she rose up
immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. <span class="verse">{8:56}</span>
Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had
been done.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:1}</span> He called the twelve together, and gave them power
and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases. <span class="verse">{9:2}</span> He sent them
forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <span class="verse">{9:3}</span> He said
to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet,
nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece. <span class="verse">{9:4}</span> Into
whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there. <span class="verse">{9:5}</span> As
many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off
even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:6}</span> They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the
Good News, and healing everywhere. <span class="verse">{9:7}</span> Now Herod the tetrarch heard
of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was
said by some that John had risen from the dead, <span class="verse">{9:8}</span> and by some that
Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had
risen again. <span class="verse">{9:9}</span> Herod said, "John I beheaded, but who is this, about
whom I hear such things?" He sought to see him. <span class="verse">{9:10}</span> The apostles,
when they had returned, told him what things they had done.</p>

<p>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city
called Bethsaida. <span class="verse">{9:11}</span> But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed
him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he
cured those who needed healing. <span class="verse">{9:12}</span> The day began to wear away; and
the twelve came, and said to him, "Send the multitude away, that they
may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get
food, for we are here in a deserted place."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:13}</span> But he said to them, "You give them something to eat."</p>

<p>They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we
should go and buy food for all these people." <span class="verse">{9:14}</span> For they were
about five thousand men.</p>

<p>He said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about
fifty each." <span class="verse">{9:15}</span> They did so, and made them all sit down. <span class="verse">{9:16}</span> He
took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he
blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set
before the multitude. <span class="verse">{9:17}</span> They ate, and were all filled. They
gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:18}</span> It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were
with him, and he asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:19}</span> They answered, "'John the Baptizer,' but others say,
'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:20}</span> He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"</p>

<p>Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:21}</span> But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no
one, <span class="verse">{9:22}</span> saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be
rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and
the third day be raised up."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:23}</span> He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him
deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. <span class="verse">{9:24}</span> For whoever
desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life
for my sake, the same will save it. <span class="verse">{9:25}</span> For what does it profit a
man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?
<span class="verse">{9:26}</span> For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will
the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of
the Father, and of the holy angels. <span class="verse">{9:27}</span> But I tell you the truth:
There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of
death, until they see the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:28}</span> It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he
took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to
pray. <span class="verse">{9:29}</span> As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered,
and his clothing became white and dazzling. <span class="verse">{9:30}</span> Behold, two men were
talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <span class="verse">{9:31}</span> who appeared in
glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to
accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:32}</span> Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep,
but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who
stood with him. <span class="verse">{9:33}</span> It happened, as they were parting from him, that
Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make
three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not
knowing what he said.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:34}</span> While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed
them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. <span class="verse">{9:35}</span> A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him!" <span class="verse">{9:36}</span> When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were
silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had
seen.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:37}</span> It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the
mountain, that a great multitude met him. <span class="verse">{9:38}</span> Behold, a man from the
crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he
is my only child. <span class="verse">{9:39}</span> Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries
out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from
him, bruising him severely. <span class="verse">{9:40}</span> I begged your disciples to cast it
out, and they couldn't."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:41}</span> Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long
shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:42}</span> While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and
convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and
healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. <span class="verse">{9:43}</span> They were all
astonished at the majesty of God.</p>

<p>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he
said to his disciples, <span class="verse">{9:44}</span> "Let these words sink into your ears, for
the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men." <span class="verse">{9:45}</span> But
they didn't understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that
they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this
saying.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:46}</span> There arose an argument among them about which of them was
the greatest. <span class="verse">{9:47}</span> Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts,
took a little child, and set him by his side, <span class="verse">{9:48}</span> and said to them,
"Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever
receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you
all, this one will be great."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:49}</span> John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in
your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't follow with us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:50}</span> Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not
against us is for us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:51}</span> It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be
taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem, <span class="verse">{9:52}</span> and sent
messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of
the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <span class="verse">{9:53}</span> They didn't receive
him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.
<span class="verse">{9:54}</span> When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord,
do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy
them, just as Elijah did?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:55}</span> But he turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind
of spirit you are. <span class="verse">{9:56}</span> For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy
men's lives, but to save them."</p>

<p>They went to another village. <span class="verse">{9:57}</span> As they went on the way, a
certain man said to him, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:58}</span> Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:59}</span> He said to another, "Follow me!"</p>

<p>But he said, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:60}</span> But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own
dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:61}</span> Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first
allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:62}</span> But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the
plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:1}</span> Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy
others, and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city
and place, where he was about to come. <span class="verse">{10:2}</span> Then he said to them,
"The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray
therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers
into his harvest. <span class="verse">{10:3}</span> Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs
among wolves. <span class="verse">{10:4}</span> Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no
one on the way. <span class="verse">{10:5}</span> Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace
be to this house.' <span class="verse">{10:6}</span> If a son of peace is there, your peace will
rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. <span class="verse">{10:7}</span> Remain in that
same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer
is worthy of his wages. Don't go from house to house. <span class="verse">{10:8}</span> Into
whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are
set before you. <span class="verse">{10:9}</span> Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them,
'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.' <span class="verse">{10:10}</span> But into whatever
city you enter, and they don't receive you, go out into its streets and
say, <span class="verse">{10:11}</span> 'Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe
off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has
come near to you.' <span class="verse">{10:12}</span> I tell you, it will be more tolerable in
that day for Sodom than for that city.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:13}</span> "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the
mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you,
they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
<span class="verse">{10:14}</span> But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the
judgment than for you. <span class="verse">{10:15}</span> You, Capernaum, who are exalted to
heaven, will be brought down to Hades. <span class="verse">{10:16}</span> Whoever
listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me.
Whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:17}</span> The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the
demons are subject to us in your name!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:18}</span> He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning
from heaven. <span class="verse">{10:19}</span> Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents
and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any
way hurt you. <span class="verse">{10:20}</span> Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the
spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in
heaven."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:21}</span> In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and
said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have
hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them
to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your
sight."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:22}</span> Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been
delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the
Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the
Son desires to reveal him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:23}</span> Turning to the disciples, he said privately, "Blessed are
the eyes which see the things that you see, <span class="verse">{10:24}</span> for I tell you that
many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and
didn't see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear
them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:25}</span> Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying,
"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:26}</span> He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read
it?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:27}</span> He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your
mind; and your neighbor as yourself."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:28}</span> He said to him, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and
you will live."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:29}</span> But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, "Who is my
neighbor?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:30}</span> Jesus answered, "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem
to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat
him, and departed, leaving him half dead. <span class="verse">{10:31}</span> By chance a certain
priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the
other side. <span class="verse">{10:32}</span> In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the
place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. <span class="verse">{10:33}</span> But a certain
Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was
moved with compassion, <span class="verse">{10:34}</span> came to him, and bound up his wounds,
pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him
to an inn, and took care of him. <span class="verse">{10:35}</span> On the next day, when he
departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said
to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay
you when I return.' <span class="verse">{10:36}</span> Now which of these three do you think
seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:37}</span> He said, "He who showed mercy on him."</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:38}</span> It happened as they went on their way, he entered into a
certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her
house. <span class="verse">{10:39}</span> She had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus'
feet, and heard his word. <span class="verse">{10:40}</span> But Martha was distracted with much
serving, and she came up to him, and said, "Lord, don't you care that
my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:41}</span> Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and
troubled about many things, <span class="verse">{10:42}</span> but one thing is needed. Mary has
chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:1}</span> It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain
place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just
as John also taught his disciples."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:2}</span> He said to them, "When you pray, say,
'Our Father in heaven,
   may your name be kept holy.
May your Kingdom come.
   May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
<span class="verse">{11:3}</span> Give us day by day our daily bread.
<span class="verse">{11:4}</span> Forgive us our sins,
   for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
Bring us not into temptation,
   but deliver us from the evil one.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:5}</span> He said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at
midnight, and tell him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, <span class="verse">{11:6}</span>
for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing
to set before him,' <span class="verse">{11:7}</span> and he from within will answer and say,
'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in
bed. I can't get up and give it to you'? <span class="verse">{11:8}</span> I tell you, although he
will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because
of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:9}</span> "I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep
seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to
you. <span class="verse">{11:10}</span> For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him
who knocks it will be opened.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:11}</span> "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give
him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won't give him a snake
instead of a fish, will he? <span class="verse">{11:12}</span> Or if he asks for an egg, he won't
give him a scorpion, will he? <span class="verse">{11:13}</span> If you then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:14}</span> He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened,
when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes
marveled. <span class="verse">{11:15}</span> But some of them said, "He casts out demons by
Beelzebul, the prince of the demons." <span class="verse">{11:16}</span> Others, testing him,
sought from him a sign from heaven. <span class="verse">{11:17}</span> But he, knowing their
thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. <span class="verse">{11:18}</span> If
Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For
you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. <span class="verse">{11:19}</span> But if I cast out
demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
will they be your judges. <span class="verse">{11:20}</span> But if I by the finger of God cast
out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:21}</span> "When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling,
his goods are safe. <span class="verse">{11:22}</span> But when someone stronger attacks him and
overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted,
and divides his spoils.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:23}</span> "He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn't gather
with me scatters. <span class="verse">{11:24}</span> The unclean spirit, when he has gone out of
the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he
says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.' <span class="verse">{11:25}</span>
When he returns, he finds it swept and put in order. <span class="verse">{11:26}</span> Then he
goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they
enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than
the first."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:27}</span> It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman
out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, "Blessed is
the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:28}</span> But he said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear
the word of God, and keep it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:29}</span> When the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began
to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign
will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet. <span class="verse">{11:30}</span> For
even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of
Man be to this generation. <span class="verse">{11:31}</span> The Queen of the South will rise up
in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them:
for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. <span class="verse">{11:32}</span> The men of
Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will
condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold,
one greater than Jonah is here.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:33}</span> "No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or
under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the
light. <span class="verse">{11:34}</span> The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye
is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil,
your body also is full of darkness. <span class="verse">{11:35}</span> Therefore see whether the
light that is in you isn't darkness. <span class="verse">{11:36}</span> If therefore your whole
body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of
light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:37}</span> Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with
him. He went in, and sat at the table. <span class="verse">{11:38}</span> When the Pharisee saw
it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
<span class="verse">{11:39}</span> The Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of
the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion
and wickedness. <span class="verse">{11:40}</span> You foolish ones, didn't he who made the
outside make the inside also? <span class="verse">{11:41}</span> But give for gifts to the needy
those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to
you. <span class="verse">{11:42}</span> But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and
every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to
have done these, and not to have left the other undone. <span class="verse">{11:43}</span> Woe to
you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the
greetings in the marketplaces. <span class="verse">{11:44}</span> Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who
walk over them don't know it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:45}</span> One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying this
you insult us also."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:46}</span> He said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with
burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift
one finger to help carry those burdens. <span class="verse">{11:47}</span> Woe to you! For you
build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <span class="verse">{11:48}</span>
So you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they
killed them, and you build their tombs. <span class="verse">{11:49}</span> Therefore also the
wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and
some of them they will kill and persecute, <span class="verse">{11:50}</span> that the blood of
all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may
be required of this generation; <span class="verse">{11:51}</span> from the blood of Abel to the
blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.'
Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation. <span class="verse">{11:52}</span> Woe to
you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter
in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:53}</span> As he said these things to them, the scribes and the
Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of
him; <span class="verse">{11:54}</span> lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch him in
something he might say, that they might accuse him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:1}</span> Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered
together, so much so that they trampled on each other, he began to tell
his disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees,
which is hypocrisy. <span class="verse">{12:2}</span> But there is nothing covered up, that will
not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known. <span class="verse">{12:3}</span> Therefore
whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What
you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the
housetops.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:4}</span> "I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who kill
the body, and after that have no more that they can do. <span class="verse">{12:5}</span> But I
will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed,
has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:6}</span> "Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins?
Not one of them is forgotten by God. <span class="verse">{12:7}</span> But the very hairs of your
head are all numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value
than many sparrows.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:8}</span> "I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will
the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God; <span class="verse">{12:9}</span> but he who
denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the
angels of God. <span class="verse">{12:10}</span> Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of
Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit
will not be forgiven. <span class="verse">{12:11}</span> When they bring you before the
synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or
what you will answer, or what you will say; <span class="verse">{12:12}</span> for the Holy Spirit
will teach you in that same hour what you must say."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:13}</span> One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother
to divide the inheritance with me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:14}</span> But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or an
arbitrator over you?" <span class="verse">{12:15}</span> He said to them, "Beware! Keep yourselves
from covetousness, for a man's life doesn't consist of the abundance of
the things which he possesses."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:16}</span> He spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain
rich man brought forth abundantly. <span class="verse">{12:17}</span> He reasoned within himself,
saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'
<span class="verse">{12:18}</span> He said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns,
and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my
goods. <span class="verse">{12:19}</span> I will tell my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up
for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:20}</span> "But God said to him, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is
required of you. The things which you have prepared--whose will they
be?' <span class="verse">{12:21}</span> So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich
toward God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:22}</span> He said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, don't be
anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what
you will wear. <span class="verse">{12:23}</span> Life is more than food, and the body is more
than clothing. <span class="verse">{12:24}</span> Consider the ravens: they don't sow, they don't
reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more
valuable are you than birds! <span class="verse">{12:25}</span> Which of you by being anxious can
add a cubit to his height? <span class="verse">{12:26}</span> If then you aren't able to do even
the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? <span class="verse">{12:27}</span> Consider
the lilies, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I
tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. <span class="verse">{12:28}</span> But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field,
which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more
will he clothe you, O you of little faith? <span class="verse">{12:29}</span> Don't seek what you
will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious. <span class="verse">{12:30}</span> For the
nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father
knows that you need these things. <span class="verse">{12:31}</span> But seek God's Kingdom, and
all these things will be added to you. <span class="verse">{12:32}</span> Don't be afraid, little
flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
<span class="verse">{12:33}</span> Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for
yourselves purses which don't grow old, a treasure in the heavens that
doesn't fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys. <span class="verse">{12:34}</span>
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:35}</span> "Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning. <span class="verse">{12:36}</span>
Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage
feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to
him. <span class="verse">{12:37}</span> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find
watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress
himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them. <span class="verse">{12:38}</span>
They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and
finds them so. <span class="verse">{12:39}</span> But know this, that if the master of the house
had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and
not allowed his house to be broken into. <span class="verse">{12:40}</span> Therefore be ready
also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect
him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:41}</span> Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to
us, or to everybody?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:42}</span> The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward,
whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion
of food at the right times? <span class="verse">{12:43}</span> Blessed is that servant whom his
lord will find doing so when he comes. <span class="verse">{12:44}</span> Truly I tell you, that
he will set him over all that he has. <span class="verse">{12:45}</span> But if that servant says
in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the
menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be
drunken, <span class="verse">{12:46}</span> then the lord of that servant will come in a day when
he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will
cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful. <span class="verse">{12:47}</span> That
servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he
wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, <span class="verse">{12:48}</span> but he who didn't
know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few
stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and
to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:49}</span> "I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already
kindled. <span class="verse">{12:50}</span> But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how
distressed I am until it is accomplished! <span class="verse">{12:51}</span> Do you think that I
have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather
division. <span class="verse">{12:52}</span> For from now on, there will be five in one house
divided, three against two, and two against three. <span class="verse">{12:53}</span> They
will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother
against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law
against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:54}</span> He said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising
from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it
happens. <span class="verse">{12:55}</span> When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a
scorching heat,' and it happens. <span class="verse">{12:56}</span> You hypocrites! You know how
to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it
that you don't interpret this time? <span class="verse">{12:57}</span> Why don't you judge for
yourselves what is right? <span class="verse">{12:58}</span> For when you are going with your
adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be
released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge
deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
<span class="verse">{12:59}</span> I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you
have paid the very last penny."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:1}</span> Now there were some present at the same time who told him
about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their
sacrifices. <span class="verse">{13:2}</span> Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these
Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they
suffered such things? <span class="verse">{13:3}</span> I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you
will all perish in the same way. <span class="verse">{13:4}</span> Or those eighteen, on whom the
tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were
worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? <span class="verse">{13:5}</span> I tell
you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:6}</span> He spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted
in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
<span class="verse">{13:7}</span> He said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have
come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down.
Why does it waste the soil?' <span class="verse">{13:8}</span> He answered, 'Lord, leave it alone
this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. <span class="verse">{13:9}</span> If it
bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:10}</span> He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.
<span class="verse">{13:11}</span> Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten
herself up. <span class="verse">{13:12}</span> When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her,
"Woman, you are freed from your infirmity." <span class="verse">{13:13}</span> He laid his hands
on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:14}</span> The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus
had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, "There are six days
in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed,
and not on the Sabbath day!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:15}</span> Therefore the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't
each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the
Sabbath, and lead him away to water? <span class="verse">{13:16}</span> Ought not this woman,
being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years,
be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:17}</span> As he said these things, all his adversaries were
disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious
things that were done by him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:18}</span> He said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I
compare it? <span class="verse">{13:19}</span> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man
took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and
the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:20}</span> Again he said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
<span class="verse">{13:21}</span> It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three
measures of flour, until it was all leavened."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:22}</span> He went on his way through cities and villages, teaching,
and traveling on to Jerusalem. <span class="verse">{13:23}</span> One said to him, "Lord, are they
few who are saved?"</p>

<p>He said to them, <span class="verse">{13:24}</span> "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for
many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able. <span class="verse">{13:25}</span>
When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door,
and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying,
'Lord, Lord, open to us!' then he will answer and tell you, 'I don't
know you or where you come from.' <span class="verse">{13:26}</span> Then you will begin to say,
'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
<span class="verse">{13:27}</span> He will say, 'I tell you, I don't know where you come from.
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.' <span class="verse">{13:28}</span> There will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown
outside. <span class="verse">{13:29}</span> They will come from the east, west, north, and south,
and will sit down in the Kingdom of God. <span class="verse">{13:30}</span> Behold, there are some
who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who
will be last."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:31}</span> On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, "Get
out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:32}</span> He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out
demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I
complete my mission. <span class="verse">{13:33}</span> Nevertheless I must go on my way today and
tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophet perish
outside of Jerusalem.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:34}</span> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones
those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children
together, like a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you
refused! <span class="verse">{13:35}</span> Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell
you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord!'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:1}</span> It happened, when he went into the house of one of the rulers
of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching
him. <span class="verse">{14:2}</span> Behold, a certain man who had dropsy was in front of him.
<span class="verse">{14:3}</span> Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:4}</span> But they were silent.</p>

<p>He took him, and healed him, and let him go. <span class="verse">{14:5}</span> He answered
them, "Which of you, if your son or an ox fell into a well,
wouldn't immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:6}</span> They couldn't answer him regarding these things.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:7}</span> He spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed
how they chose the best seats, and said to them, <span class="verse">{14:8}</span> "When you are
invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat,
since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him,
<span class="verse">{14:9}</span> and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make
room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the
lowest place. <span class="verse">{14:10}</span> But when you are invited, go and sit in the
lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes, he may tell you,
'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of
all who sit at the table with you. <span class="verse">{14:11}</span> For everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:12}</span> He also said to the one who had invited him, "When you make
a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor your brothers, nor
your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the
favor, and pay you back. <span class="verse">{14:13}</span> But when you make a feast, ask the
poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; <span class="verse">{14:14}</span> and you will be
blessed, because they don't have the resources to repay you. For you
will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:15}</span> When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these
things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who will feast in the Kingdom of
God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:16}</span> But he said to him, "A certain man made a great supper, and
he invited many people. <span class="verse">{14:17}</span> He sent out his servant at supper time
to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
<span class="verse">{14:18}</span> They all as one began to make excuses.</p>

<p>"The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and
see it. Please have me excused.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:19}</span> "Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must
go try them out. Please have me excused.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:20}</span> "Another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I can't
come.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:21}</span> "That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the
master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly
into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed,
blind, and lame.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:22}</span> "The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and
there is still room.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:23}</span> "The lord said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
<span class="verse">{14:24}</span> For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will
taste of my supper.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:25}</span> Now great multitudes were going with him. He turned and said
to them, <span class="verse">{14:26}</span> "If anyone comes to me, and doesn't
disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers,
and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he can't be my disciple.
<span class="verse">{14:27}</span> Whoever doesn't bear his own cross, and come after me, can't be
my disciple. <span class="verse">{14:28}</span> For which of you, desiring to build a tower,
doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to
complete it? <span class="verse">{14:29}</span> Or perhaps, when he has laid a foundation, and is
not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock him, <span class="verse">{14:30}</span>
saying, 'This man began to build, and wasn't able to finish.' <span class="verse">{14:31}</span>
Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, will not sit
down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet
him who comes against him with twenty thousand? <span class="verse">{14:32}</span> Or else, while
the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks for
conditions of peace. <span class="verse">{14:33}</span> So therefore whoever of you who doesn't
renounce all that he has, he can't be my disciple. <span class="verse">{14:34}</span> Salt is
good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you
season it? <span class="verse">{14:35}</span> It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure
pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:1}</span> Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to
him to hear him. <span class="verse">{15:2}</span> The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying,
"This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:3}</span> He told them this parable. <span class="verse">{15:4}</span> "Which of you men, if you
had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the
ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost,
until he found it? <span class="verse">{15:5}</span> When he has found it, he carries it on his
shoulders, rejoicing. <span class="verse">{15:6}</span> When he comes home, he calls together his
friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have
found my sheep which was lost!' <span class="verse">{15:7}</span> I tell you that even so there
will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. <span class="verse">{15:8}</span> Or what
woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma
coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until
she found it? <span class="verse">{15:9}</span> When she has found it, she calls together her
friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the
drachma which I had lost.' <span class="verse">{15:10}</span> Even so, I tell you, there is joy in
the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:11}</span> He said, "A certain man had two sons. <span class="verse">{15:12}</span> The younger of
them said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of your property.'
He divided his livelihood between them. <span class="verse">{15:13}</span> Not many days after,
the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far
country. There he wasted his property with riotous living. <span class="verse">{15:14}</span> When
he had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country,
and he began to be in need. <span class="verse">{15:15}</span> He went and joined himself to one
of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to
feed pigs. <span class="verse">{15:16}</span> He wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the
pigs ate, but no one gave him any. <span class="verse">{15:17}</span> But when he came to himself
he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough to
spare, and I'm dying with hunger! <span class="verse">{15:18}</span> I will get up and go to my
father, and will tell him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
in your sight. <span class="verse">{15:19}</span> I am no more worthy to be called your son. Make
me as one of your hired servants."'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:20}</span> "He arose, and came to his father. But while he was still
far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran,
and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <span class="verse">{15:21}</span> The son said to him,
'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no
longer worthy to be called your son.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:22}</span> "But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best
robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.
<span class="verse">{15:23}</span> Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and
celebrate; <span class="verse">{15:24}</span> for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He
was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:25}</span> "Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the
house, he heard music and dancing. <span class="verse">{15:26}</span> He called one of the
servants to him, and asked what was going on. <span class="verse">{15:27}</span> He said to him,
'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf,
because he has received him back safe and healthy.' <span class="verse">{15:28}</span> But he was
angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged
him. <span class="verse">{15:29}</span> But he answered his father, 'Behold, these many years I
have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you
never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. <span class="verse">{15:30}</span>
But when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with
prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:31}</span> "He said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that
is mine is yours. <span class="verse">{15:32}</span> But it was appropriate to celebrate and be
glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was
lost, and is found.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:1}</span> He also said to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man
who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was
wasting his possessions. <span class="verse">{16:2}</span> He called him, and said to him, 'What
is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management,
for you can no longer be manager.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:3}</span> "The manager said within himself, 'What will I do, seeing
that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don't
have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg. <span class="verse">{16:4}</span> I know what I will
do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into
their houses.' <span class="verse">{16:5}</span> Calling each one of his lord's debtors to him, he
said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?' <span class="verse">{16:6}</span> He said, 'A
hundred batos of oil.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and
sit down quickly and write fifty.' <span class="verse">{16:7}</span> Then he said to another, 'How
much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' He said
to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:8}</span> "His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done
wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation,
wiser than the children of the light. <span class="verse">{16:9}</span> I tell you, make for
yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you
fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents. <span class="verse">{16:10}</span> He who is
faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest
in a very little is also dishonest in much. <span class="verse">{16:11}</span> If therefore you
have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to
your trust the true riches? <span class="verse">{16:12}</span> If you have not been faithful in
that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
<span class="verse">{16:13}</span> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the
one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the
other. You aren't able to serve God and mammon."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:14}</span> The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all
these things, and they scoffed at him. <span class="verse">{16:15}</span> He said to them, "You
are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows
your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in
the sight of God. <span class="verse">{16:16}</span> The law and the prophets were until John.
From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and
everyone is forcing his way into it. <span class="verse">{16:17}</span> But it is easier for
heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the
law to fall. <span class="verse">{16:18}</span> Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries
another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a
husband commits adultery.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:19}</span> "Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in
purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day. <span class="verse">{16:20}</span> A certain
beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores, <span class="verse">{16:21}</span> and
desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table.
Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores. <span class="verse">{16:22}</span> It happened that
the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to
Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. <span class="verse">{16:23}</span> In
Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw
Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom. <span class="verse">{16:24}</span> He cried and said,
'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip
the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish
in this flame.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:25}</span> "But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you, in your
lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad
things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish. <span class="verse">{16:26}</span>
Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that
those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may
cross over from there to us.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:27}</span> "He said, 'I ask you therefore, father, that you would send
him to my father's house; <span class="verse">{16:28}</span> for I have five brothers, that he may
testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:29}</span> "But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets.
Let them listen to them.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:30}</span> "He said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from
the dead, they will repent.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:31}</span> "He said to him, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:1}</span> He said to the disciples, "It is impossible that no occasions
of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! <span class="verse">{17:2}</span>
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck,
and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one
of these little ones to stumble. <span class="verse">{17:3}</span> Be careful. If your brother
sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. <span class="verse">{17:4}</span> If he
sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns,
saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:5}</span> The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:6}</span> The Lord said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard
seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted
in the sea,' and it would obey you. <span class="verse">{17:7}</span> But who is there among you,
having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when he comes
in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,' <span class="verse">{17:8}</span>
and will not rather tell him, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself
properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat
and drink'? <span class="verse">{17:9}</span> Does he thank that servant because he did the things
that were commanded? I think not. <span class="verse">{17:10}</span> Even so you also, when you
have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy
servants. We have done our duty.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:11}</span> It happened as he was on his way to Jerusalem, that he was
passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee. <span class="verse">{17:12}</span> As he entered
into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a
distance. <span class="verse">{17:13}</span> They lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master,
have mercy on us!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:14}</span> When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves
to the priests." It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
<span class="verse">{17:15}</span> One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
glorifying God with a loud voice. <span class="verse">{17:16}</span> He fell on his face at Jesus'
feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. <span class="verse">{17:17}</span> Jesus
answered, "Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? <span class="verse">{17:18}</span>
Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this
stranger?" <span class="verse">{17:19}</span> Then he said to him, "Get up, and go your way. Your
faith has healed you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:20}</span> Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would
come, he answered them, "The Kingdom of God doesn't come with
observation; <span class="verse">{17:21}</span> neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look,
there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:22}</span> He said to the disciples, "The days will come, when you will
desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see
it. <span class="verse">{17:23}</span> They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't
go away, nor follow after them, <span class="verse">{17:24}</span> for as the lightning, when it
flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part
under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. <span class="verse">{17:25}</span> But first,
he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. <span class="verse">{17:26}</span>
As it happened in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days
of the Son of Man. <span class="verse">{17:27}</span> They ate, they drank, they married, they
were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,
and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <span class="verse">{17:28}</span> Likewise, even as
it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they
sold, they planted, they built; <span class="verse">{17:29}</span> but in the day that Lot went
out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed
them all. <span class="verse">{17:30}</span> It will be the same way in the day that the Son of
Man is revealed. <span class="verse">{17:31}</span> In that day, he who will be on the housetop,
and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away. Let
him who is in the field likewise not turn back. <span class="verse">{17:32}</span> Remember Lot's
wife! <span class="verse">{17:33}</span> Whoever seeks to save his life loses it, but whoever
loses his life preserves it. <span class="verse">{17:34}</span> I tell you, in that night there
will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other
will be left. <span class="verse">{17:35}</span> There will be two grinding grain together. One
will be taken, and the other will be left." <span class="verse">{17:36}</span> </p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:37}</span> They, answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?"</p>

<p>He said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also be
gathered together."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:1}</span> He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray,
and not give up, <span class="verse">{18:2}</span> saying, "There was a judge in a certain city
who didn't fear God, and didn't respect man. <span class="verse">{18:3}</span> A widow was in that
city, and she often came to him, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'
<span class="verse">{18:4}</span> He wouldn't for a while, but afterward he said to himself,
'Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, <span class="verse">{18:5}</span> yet because this
widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by
her continual coming.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:6}</span> The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
<span class="verse">{18:7}</span> Won't God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day
and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? <span class="verse">{18:8}</span> I tell you
that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man
comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:9}</span> He spoke also this parable to certain people who were
convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.
<span class="verse">{18:10}</span> "Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee,
and the other was a tax collector. <span class="verse">{18:11}</span> The Pharisee stood and
prayed to himself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the
rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this
tax collector. <span class="verse">{18:12}</span> I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I
get.' <span class="verse">{18:13}</span> But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even
lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be
merciful to me, a sinner!' <span class="verse">{18:14}</span> I tell you, this man went down to
his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:15}</span> They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might
touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <span class="verse">{18:16}</span>
Jesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me,
and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
<span class="verse">{18:17}</span> Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom
of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:18}</span> A certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall
I do to inherit eternal life?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:19}</span> Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good,
except one--God. <span class="verse">{18:20}</span> You know the commandments: 'Don't commit
adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,'
'Honor your father and your mother.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:21}</span> He said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:22}</span> When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "You still
lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor.
You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:23}</span> But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he
was very rich.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:24}</span> Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, "How hard it is
for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! <span class="verse">{18:25}</span> For
it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a
rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:26}</span> Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:27}</span> But he said, "The things which are impossible with men are
possible with God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:28}</span> Peter said, "Look, we have left everything, and followed
you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:29}</span> He said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one
who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for
the Kingdom of God's sake, <span class="verse">{18:30}</span> who will not receive many times more
in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:31}</span> He took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are
going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the
prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. <span class="verse">{18:32}</span> For he
will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated
shamefully, and spit on. <span class="verse">{18:33}</span> They will scourge and kill him. On the
third day, he will rise again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:34}</span> They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden
from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.
<span class="verse">{18:35}</span> It happened, as he came near Jericho, a certain blind man sat
by the road, begging. <span class="verse">{18:36}</span> Hearing a multitude going by, he asked
what this meant. <span class="verse">{18:37}</span> They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was
passing by. <span class="verse">{18:38}</span> He cried out, "Jesus, you son of David, have mercy
on me!" <span class="verse">{18:39}</span> Those who led the way rebuked him, that he should be
quiet; but he cried out all the more, "You son of David, have mercy on
me!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:40}</span> Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him.
When he had come near, he asked him, <span class="verse">{18:41}</span> "What do you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>He said, "Lord, that I may see again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:42}</span> Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has
healed you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:43}</span> Immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:1}</span> He entered and was passing through Jericho. <span class="verse">{19:2}</span> There was
a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
<span class="verse">{19:3}</span> He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn't because of the
crowd, because he was short. <span class="verse">{19:4}</span> He ran on ahead, and climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. <span class="verse">{19:5}</span>
When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to
him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your
house." <span class="verse">{19:6}</span> He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. <span class="verse">{19:7}</span>
When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, "He has gone in to lodge
with a man who is a sinner."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:8}</span> Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of
my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of
anyone, I restore four times as much."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:9}</span> Jesus said to him, "Today, salvation has come to this house,
because he also is a son of Abraham. <span class="verse">{19:10}</span> For the Son of Man came to
seek and to save that which was lost."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:11}</span> As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable,
because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of
God would be revealed immediately. <span class="verse">{19:12}</span> He said therefore, "A
certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a
kingdom, and to return. <span class="verse">{19:13}</span> He called ten servants of his, and gave
them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I
come.' <span class="verse">{19:14}</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him,
saying, 'We don't want this man to reign over us.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:15}</span> "It happened when he had come back again, having received
the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the
money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by
conducting business. <span class="verse">{19:16}</span> The first came before him, saying, 'Lord,
your mina has made ten more minas.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:17}</span> "He said to him, 'Well done, you good servant! Because you
were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten
cities.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:18}</span> "The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five
minas.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:19}</span> "So he said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
<span class="verse">{19:20}</span> Another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept
laid away in a handkerchief, <span class="verse">{19:21}</span> for I feared you, because you are
an exacting man. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap
that which you didn't sow.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:22}</span> "He said to him, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you,
you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that
which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I didn't sow. <span class="verse">{19:23}</span>
Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I
might have earned interest on it?' <span class="verse">{19:24}</span> He said to those who stood
by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has the ten
minas.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:25}</span> "They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas!' <span class="verse">{19:26}</span> 'For I
tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who
doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
<span class="verse">{19:27}</span> But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign
over them here, and kill them before me.'" <span class="verse">{19:28}</span> Having said these
things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:29}</span> It happened, when he drew near to Bethsphage and
Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his
disciples, <span class="verse">{19:30}</span> saying, "Go your way into the village on the other
side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man
ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it. <span class="verse">{19:31}</span> If anyone asks you, 'Why
are you untying it?' say to him: 'The Lord needs it.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:32}</span> Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he
had told them. <span class="verse">{19:33}</span> As they were untying the colt, its owners said
to them, "Why are you untying the colt?" <span class="verse">{19:34}</span> They said, "The Lord
needs it." <span class="verse">{19:35}</span> They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on
the colt, and set Jesus on them. <span class="verse">{19:36}</span> As he went, they spread their
cloaks in the way. <span class="verse">{19:37}</span> As he was now getting near, at the descent
of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which
they had seen, <span class="verse">{19:38}</span> saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the
name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:39}</span> Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him,
"Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:40}</span> He answered them, "I tell you that if these were silent, the
stones would cry out."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:41}</span> When he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it, <span class="verse">{19:42}</span>
saying, "If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to
your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes. <span class="verse">{19:43}</span> For the
days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade
against you, surround you, hem you in on every side, <span class="verse">{19:44}</span> and will
dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not
leave in you one stone on another, because you didn't know the time of
your visitation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:45}</span> He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who
bought and sold in it, <span class="verse">{19:46}</span> saying to them, "It is written, 'My
house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of
robbers'!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:47}</span> He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests
and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy
him. <span class="verse">{19:48}</span> They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people
hung on to every word that he said.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:1}</span> It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the
people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests
and scribes came to him with the elders. <span class="verse">{20:2}</span> They asked him, "Tell
us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this
authority?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:3}</span> He answered them, "I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
<span class="verse">{20:4}</span> the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:5}</span> They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From
heaven,' he will say, 'Why didn't you believe him?' <span class="verse">{20:6}</span> But if we
say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded
that John was a prophet." <span class="verse">{20:7}</span> They answered that they didn't know
where it was from.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:8}</span> Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what
authority I do these things."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:9}</span> He began to tell the people this parable. "A man planted
a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another
country for a long time. <span class="verse">{20:10}</span> At the proper season, he sent a
servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the
vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty. <span class="verse">{20:11}</span> He
sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him
shamefully, and sent him away empty. <span class="verse">{20:12}</span> He sent yet a third, and
they also wounded him, and threw him out. <span class="verse">{20:13}</span> The lord of the
vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be
that seeing him, they will respect him.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:14}</span> "But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among
themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, that the
inheritance may be ours.' <span class="verse">{20:15}</span> They threw him out of the vineyard,
and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to
them? <span class="verse">{20:16}</span> He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others."</p>

<p>When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:17}</span> But he looked at them, and said, "Then what is this that is
written,
'The stone which the builders rejected,
   the same was made the chief cornerstone?'
<span class="verse">{20:18}</span> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces,
   but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:19}</span> The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him
that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew he had spoken
this parable against them. <span class="verse">{20:20}</span> They watched him, and sent out
spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in
something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority
of the governor. <span class="verse">{20:21}</span> They asked him, "Teacher, we know that you say
and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach
the way of God. <span class="verse">{20:22}</span> Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or
not?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:23}</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "Why do
you test me? <span class="verse">{20:24}</span> Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription
are on it?"</p>

<p>They answered, "Caesar's."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:25}</span> He said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are
Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:26}</span> They weren't able to trap him in his words before the
people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent. <span class="verse">{20:27}</span> Some of
the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
<span class="verse">{20:28}</span> They asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's
brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should
take the wife, and raise up children for his brother. <span class="verse">{20:29}</span> There
were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died
childless. <span class="verse">{20:30}</span> The second took her as wife, and he died childless.
<span class="verse">{20:31}</span> The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no
children, and died. <span class="verse">{20:32}</span> Afterward the woman also died. <span class="verse">{20:33}</span>
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the
seven had her as a wife."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:34}</span> Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are
given in marriage. <span class="verse">{20:35}</span> But those who are considered worthy to
attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry,
nor are given in marriage. <span class="verse">{20:36}</span> For they can't die any more, for
they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
the resurrection. <span class="verse">{20:37}</span> But that the dead are raised, even Moses
showed at the bush, when he called the Lord 'The God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' <span class="verse">{20:38}</span> Now he is not the God
of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:39}</span> Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."
<span class="verse">{20:40}</span> They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:41}</span> He said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is David's
son? <span class="verse">{20:42}</span> David himself says in the book of Psalms,
'The Lord said to my Lord,
   "Sit at my right hand,
   <span class="verse">{20:43}</span> until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:44}</span> "David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:45}</span> In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
<span class="verse">{20:46}</span> "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and
love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues,
and the best places at feasts; <span class="verse">{20:47}</span> who devour widows' houses, and
for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater
condemnation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:1}</span> He looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their
gifts into the treasury. <span class="verse">{21:2}</span> He saw a certain poor widow casting in
two small brass coins. <span class="verse">{21:3}</span> He said, "Truly I tell you,
this poor widow put in more than all of them, <span class="verse">{21:4}</span> for all these put
in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put
in all that she had to live on."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:5}</span> As some were talking about the temple and how it was
decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said, <span class="verse">{21:6}</span> "As for
these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not
be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:7}</span> They asked him, "Teacher, so when will these things be? What
is the sign that these things are about to happen?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:8}</span> He said, "Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many
will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is at
hand.' Therefore don't follow them. <span class="verse">{21:9}</span> When you hear of wars and
disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first,
but the end won't come immediately."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:10}</span> Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom. <span class="verse">{21:11}</span> There will be great earthquakes,
famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great
signs from heaven. <span class="verse">{21:12}</span> But before all these things, they will lay
their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to
synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name's sake. <span class="verse">{21:13}</span> It will turn out as a testimony for you. <span class="verse">{21:14}</span>
Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to
answer, <span class="verse">{21:15}</span> for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your
adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict. <span class="verse">{21:16}</span> You
will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends.
They will cause some of you to be put to death. <span class="verse">{21:17}</span> You will be
hated by all men for my name's sake. <span class="verse">{21:18}</span> And not a hair of your
head will perish.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:19}</span> "By your endurance you will win your lives.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:20}</span> "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know
that its desolation is at hand. <span class="verse">{21:21}</span> Then let those who are in Judea
flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart.
Let those who are in the country not enter therein. <span class="verse">{21:22}</span> For these
are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
fulfilled. <span class="verse">{21:23}</span> Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse
infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land,
and wrath to this people. <span class="verse">{21:24}</span> They will fall by the edge of the
sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be
trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled. <span class="verse">{21:25}</span> There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and
on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the
sea and the waves; <span class="verse">{21:26}</span> men fainting for fear, and for expectation
of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the
heavens will be shaken. <span class="verse">{21:27}</span> Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <span class="verse">{21:28}</span> But when these
things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your
redemption is near."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:29}</span> He told them a parable. "See the fig tree, and all the
trees. <span class="verse">{21:30}</span> When they are already budding, you see it and know by
your own selves that the summer is already near. <span class="verse">{21:31}</span> Even so you
also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God
is near. <span class="verse">{21:32}</span> Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not
pass away until all things are accomplished. <span class="verse">{21:33}</span> Heaven and earth
will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:34}</span> "So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with
carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come
on you suddenly. <span class="verse">{21:35}</span> For it will come like a snare on all those who
dwell on the surface of all the earth. <span class="verse">{21:36}</span> Therefore be watchful
all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all
these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:37}</span> Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night
he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called
Olivet. <span class="verse">{21:38}</span> All the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple to hear him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:1}</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the
Passover, drew near. <span class="verse">{22:2}</span> The chief priests and the scribes sought
how they might put him to death, for they feared the people. <span class="verse">{22:3}</span>
Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered
with the twelve. <span class="verse">{22:4}</span> He went away, and talked with the chief priests
and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <span class="verse">{22:5}</span> They were
glad, and agreed to give him money. <span class="verse">{22:6}</span> He consented, and sought an
opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.
<span class="verse">{22:7}</span> The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be
sacrificed. <span class="verse">{22:8}</span> He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the
Passover for us, that we may eat."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:9}</span> They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:10}</span> He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the
city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into
the house which he enters. <span class="verse">{22:11}</span> Tell the master of the house, 'The
Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the
Passover with my disciples?"' <span class="verse">{22:12}</span> He will show you a large,
furnished upper room. Make preparations there."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:13}</span> They went, found things as he had told them, and they
prepared the Passover. <span class="verse">{22:14}</span> When the hour had come, he sat down with
the twelve apostles. <span class="verse">{22:15}</span> He said to them, "I have earnestly desired
to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, <span class="verse">{22:16}</span> for I tell you,
I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the
Kingdom of God." <span class="verse">{22:17}</span> He received a cup, and when he had given
thanks, he said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves, <span class="verse">{22:18}</span> for
I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine,
until the Kingdom of God comes."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:19}</span> He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it,
and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do
this in memory of me." <span class="verse">{22:20}</span> Likewise, he took the cup after supper,
saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out
for you. <span class="verse">{22:21}</span> But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me
on the table. <span class="verse">{22:22}</span> The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been
determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:23}</span> They began to question among themselves, which of them it
was who would do this thing. <span class="verse">{22:24}</span> There arose also a contention
among them, which of them was considered to be greatest. <span class="verse">{22:25}</span> He
said to them, "The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those
who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.' <span class="verse">{22:26}</span> But not
so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as
the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. <span class="verse">{22:27}</span> For
who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it
he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who
serves. <span class="verse">{22:28}</span> But you are those who have continued with me in my
trials. <span class="verse">{22:29}</span> I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred
on me, <span class="verse">{22:30}</span> that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom.
You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:31}</span> The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have
you, that he might sift you as wheat, <span class="verse">{22:32}</span> but I prayed for you,
that your faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again,
establish your brothers."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:33}</span> He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to
prison and to death!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:34}</span> He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means
crow today until you deny that you know me three times."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:35}</span> He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and
wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?"</p>

<p>They said, "Nothing."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:36}</span> Then he said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let him
take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his
cloak, and buy a sword. <span class="verse">{22:37}</span> For I tell you that this which is
written must still be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted with
transgressors.' For that which concerns me has an end."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:38}</span> They said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords."</p>

<p>He said to them, "That is enough."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:39}</span> He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of
Olives. His disciples also followed him. <span class="verse">{22:40}</span> When he was at the
place, he said to them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:41}</span> He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he
knelt down and prayed, <span class="verse">{22:42}</span> saying, "Father, if you are willing,
remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:43}</span> An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
<span class="verse">{22:44}</span> Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like
great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:45}</span> When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples,
and found them sleeping because of grief, <span class="verse">{22:46}</span> and said to them,
"Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into
temptation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:47}</span> While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who
was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to
Jesus to kiss him. <span class="verse">{22:48}</span> But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray
the Son of Man with a kiss?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:49}</span> When those who were around him saw what was about to happen,
they said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?" <span class="verse">{22:50}</span> A
certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off
his right ear.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:51}</span> But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this"--and he
touched his ear, and healed him. <span class="verse">{22:52}</span> Jesus said to the chief
priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him,
"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? <span class="verse">{22:53}</span>
When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch out your
hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:54}</span> They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the
high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance. <span class="verse">{22:55}</span> When
they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat
down together, Peter sat among them. <span class="verse">{22:56}</span> A certain servant girl saw
him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, "This
man also was with him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:57}</span> He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I don't know him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:58}</span> After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You
also are one of them!"</p>

<p>But Peter answered, "Man, I am not!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:59}</span> After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed,
saying, "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:60}</span> But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking
about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
<span class="verse">{22:61}</span> The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the
Lord's word, how he said to him, "Before the rooster crows you will
deny me three times." <span class="verse">{22:62}</span> He went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:63}</span> The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. <span class="verse">{22:64}</span>
Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him,
"Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?" <span class="verse">{22:65}</span> They spoke many
other things against him, insulting him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:66}</span> As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the
people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they
led him away into their council, saying, <span class="verse">{22:67}</span> "If you are the
Christ, tell us."</p>

<p>But he said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe, <span class="verse">{22:68}</span> and
if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. <span class="verse">{22:69}</span> From now
on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of
God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:70}</span> They all said, "Are you then the Son of God?"</p>

<p>He said to them, "You say it, because I am."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{22:71}</span> They said, "Why do we need any more witness? For we
ourselves have heard from his own mouth!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:1}</span> The whole company of them rose up and brought him before
Pilate. <span class="verse">{23:2}</span> They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man
perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying
that he himself is Christ, a king."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:3}</span> Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p>He answered him, "So you say."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:4}</span> Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find
no basis for a charge against this man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:5}</span> But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching
throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."
<span class="verse">{23:6}</span> But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was
a Galilean. <span class="verse">{23:7}</span> When he found out that he was in Herod's
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during
those days.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:8}</span> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had
wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things
about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. <span class="verse">{23:9}</span> He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <span class="verse">{23:10}</span> The
chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <span class="verse">{23:11}</span>
Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in
luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. <span class="verse">{23:12}</span> Herod and
Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that
they were enemies with each other.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:13}</span> Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and
the people, <span class="verse">{23:14}</span> and said to them, "You brought this man to me as
one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you,
and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those
things of which you accuse him. <span class="verse">{23:15}</span> Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
<span class="verse">{23:16}</span> I will therefore chastise him and release him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:17}</span> Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
<span class="verse">{23:18}</span> But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this man!
Release to us Barabbas!"--<span class="verse">{23:19}</span> one who was thrown into prison for a
certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:20}</span> Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
<span class="verse">{23:21}</span> but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify him!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:22}</span> He said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this man
done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise
him and release him." <span class="verse">{23:23}</span> But they were urgent with loud voices,
asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the
chief priests prevailed. <span class="verse">{23:24}</span> Pilate decreed that what they asked
for should be done. <span class="verse">{23:25}</span> He released him who had been thrown into
prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he
delivered Jesus up to their will.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:26}</span> When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene,
coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after
Jesus. <span class="verse">{23:27}</span> A great multitude of the people followed him, including
women who also mourned and lamented him. <span class="verse">{23:28}</span> But Jesus, turning to
them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for
yourselves and for your children. <span class="verse">{23:29}</span> For behold, the days are
coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that
never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.' <span class="verse">{23:30}</span> Then they will
begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover
us.' <span class="verse">{23:31}</span> For if they do these things in the green tree, what
will be done in the dry?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:32}</span> There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be
put to death. <span class="verse">{23:33}</span> When they came to the place that is called The
Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right
and the other on the left.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:34}</span> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what
they are doing."</p>

<p>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <span class="verse">{23:35}</span> The people
stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, "He
saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his
chosen one!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:36}</span> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him
vinegar, <span class="verse">{23:37}</span> and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save
yourself!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:38}</span> An inscription was also written over him in letters of
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:39}</span> One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying,
"If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:40}</span> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don't you
even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? <span class="verse">{23:41}</span> And
we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this
man has done nothing wrong." <span class="verse">{23:42}</span> He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember
me when you come into your Kingdom."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:43}</span> Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be
with me in Paradise."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:44}</span> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came
over the whole land until the ninth hour. <span class="verse">{23:45}</span> The sun was
darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. <span class="verse">{23:46}</span> Jesus,
crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!" Having said this, he breathed his last.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:47}</span> When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
saying, "Certainly this was a righteous man." <span class="verse">{23:48}</span> All the
multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <span class="verse">{23:49}</span> All his
acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood
at a distance, watching these things.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{23:50}</span> Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council,
a good and righteous man <span class="verse">{23:51}</span> (he had not consented to their counsel
and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting
for the Kingdom of God: <span class="verse">{23:52}</span> this man went to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus' body. <span class="verse">{23:53}</span> He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth,
and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever
been laid. <span class="verse">{23:54}</span> It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath
was drawing near. <span class="verse">{23:55}</span> The women, who had come with him out of
Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
<span class="verse">{23:56}</span> They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the
Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:1}</span> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and
some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had
prepared. <span class="verse">{24:2}</span> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. <span class="verse">{24:3}</span>
They entered in, and didn't find the Lord Jesus' body. <span class="verse">{24:4}</span> It
happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men
stood by them in dazzling clothing. <span class="verse">{24:5}</span> Becoming terrified, they
bowed their faces down to the earth.</p>

<p>They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
<span class="verse">{24:6}</span> He isn't here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he
was still in Galilee, <span class="verse">{24:7}</span> saying that the Son of Man must be
delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:8}</span> They remembered his words, <span class="verse">{24:9}</span> returned from the tomb, and
told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. <span class="verse">{24:10}</span> Now
they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The
other women with them told these things to the apostles. <span class="verse">{24:11}</span> These
words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn't believe them.
<span class="verse">{24:12}</span> But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in,
he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his
home, wondering what had happened.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:13}</span> Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village
named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. <span class="verse">{24:14}</span>
They talked with each other about all of these things which had
happened. <span class="verse">{24:15}</span> It happened, while they talked and questioned
together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them. <span class="verse">{24:16}</span> But
their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <span class="verse">{24:17}</span> He said to them,
"What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:18}</span> One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only
stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened
there in these days?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:19}</span> He said to them, "What things?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who
was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
<span class="verse">{24:20}</span> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be
condemned to death, and crucified him. <span class="verse">{24:21}</span> But we were hoping that
it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now
the third day since these things happened. <span class="verse">{24:22}</span> Also, certain women
of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <span class="verse">{24:23}</span> and
when they didn't find his body, they came saying that they had also
seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span class="verse">{24:24}</span> Some of us
went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they
didn't see him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:25}</span> He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
in all that the prophets have spoken! <span class="verse">{24:26}</span> Didn't the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory?" <span class="verse">{24:27}</span> Beginning
from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning himself. <span class="verse">{24:28}</span> They drew near to the
village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:29}</span> They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost
evening, and the day is almost over."</p>

<p>He went in to stay with them. <span class="verse">{24:30}</span> It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them. <span class="verse">{24:31}</span> Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <span class="verse">{24:32}</span> They said
one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke
to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?" <span class="verse">{24:33}</span>
They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the
eleven gathered together, and those who were with them, <span class="verse">{24:34}</span> saying,
"The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!" <span class="verse">{24:35}</span> They
related the things that happened along the way, and how he was
recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:36}</span> As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them,
and said to them, "Peace be to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:37}</span> But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed
that they had seen a spirit.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:38}</span> He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise
in your hearts? <span class="verse">{24:39}</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me.
Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see
that I have." <span class="verse">{24:40}</span> When he had said this, he showed them his hands
and his feet. <span class="verse">{24:41}</span> While they still didn't believe for joy, and
wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:42}</span> They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
<span class="verse">{24:43}</span> He took them, and ate in front of them. <span class="verse">{24:44}</span> He said to
them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all
things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the
psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:45}</span> Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the
Scriptures. <span class="verse">{24:46}</span> He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it
was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the
third day, <span class="verse">{24:47}</span> and that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
<span class="verse">{24:48}</span> You are witnesses of these things. <span class="verse">{24:49}</span> Behold, I send forth
the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem
until you are clothed with power from on high."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{24:50}</span> He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them. <span class="verse">{24:51}</span> It happened, while he blessed them,
that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. <span class="verse">{24:52}</span>
They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <span class="verse">{24:53}</span>
and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>



<h2>John</h2>

<p><span class="verse">{1:1}</span> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. <span class="verse">{1:2}</span> The same was in the beginning with God. <span class="verse">{1:3}</span>
All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made
that has been made. <span class="verse">{1:4}</span> In him was life, and the life was the light
of men. <span class="verse">{1:5}</span> The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
overcome it. <span class="verse">{1:6}</span> There came a man, sent from God, whose name
was John. <span class="verse">{1:7}</span> The same came as a witness, that he might testify about
the light, that all might believe through him. <span class="verse">{1:8}</span> He was not the
light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. <span class="verse">{1:9}</span> The
true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:10}</span> He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and
the world didn't recognize him. <span class="verse">{1:11}</span> He came to his own, and those
who were his own didn't receive him. <span class="verse">{1:12}</span> But as many as received
him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who
believe in his name: <span class="verse">{1:13}</span> who were born not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <span class="verse">{1:14}</span> The Word
became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of
the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <span class="verse">{1:15}</span>
John testified about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I
said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
<span class="verse">{1:16}</span> From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. <span class="verse">{1:17}</span> For
the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through
Jesus Christ. <span class="verse">{1:18}</span> No one has seen God at any time. The one and only
Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:19}</span> This is John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:20}</span> He declared, and didn't deny, but he declared, "I am not the
Christ."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:21}</span> They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"</p>

<p>He said, "I am not."</p>

<p>"Are you the prophet?"</p>

<p>He answered, "No."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:22}</span> They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer
to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:23}</span> He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:24}</span> The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. <span class="verse">{1:25}</span>
They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:26}</span> John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands
one whom you don't know. <span class="verse">{1:27}</span> He is the one who comes after me, who
is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."
<span class="verse">{1:28}</span> These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:29}</span> The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold,
the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <span class="verse">{1:30}</span> This is he
of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for
he was before me.' <span class="verse">{1:31}</span> I didn't know him, but for this reason I came
baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel." <span class="verse">{1:32}</span> John
testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out
of heaven, and it remained on him. <span class="verse">{1:33}</span> I didn't recognize him, but
he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you
will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.' <span class="verse">{1:34}</span> I have seen, and have
testified that this is the Son of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:35}</span> Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his
disciples, <span class="verse">{1:36}</span> and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said,
"Behold, the Lamb of God!" <span class="verse">{1:37}</span> The two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus. <span class="verse">{1:38}</span> Jesus turned, and saw them following,
and said to them, "What are you looking for?"</p>

<p>They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), "where are you staying?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:39}</span> He said to them, "Come, and see."</p>

<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him
that day. It was about the tenth hour. <span class="verse">{1:40}</span> One of the two
who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
<span class="verse">{1:41}</span> He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have
found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
<span class="verse">{1:42}</span> He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are
Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by
interpretation, Peter). <span class="verse">{1:43}</span> On the next day, he was determined to go
out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
<span class="verse">{1:44}</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
<span class="verse">{1:45}</span> Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of
whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the
son of Joseph."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:46}</span> Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?"</p>

<p>Philip said to him, "Come and see."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:47}</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,
"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:48}</span> Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under
the fig tree, I saw you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:49}</span> Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You
are King of Israel!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{1:50}</span> Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you
underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things
than these!" <span class="verse">{1:51}</span> He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you,
hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending on the Son of Man."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:1}</span> The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus'
mother was there. <span class="verse">{2:2}</span> Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to
the marriage. <span class="verse">{2:3}</span> When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him,
"They have no wine."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:4}</span> Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you
and me? My hour has not yet come."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:5}</span> His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do
it." <span class="verse">{2:6}</span> Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the
Jews' way of purifying, containing two or three metretes
apiece. <span class="verse">{2:7}</span> Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water."
They filled them up to the brim. <span class="verse">{2:8}</span> He said to them, "Now draw some
out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it. <span class="verse">{2:9}</span>
When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and
didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the
water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom, <span class="verse">{2:10}</span> and
said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests
have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good
wine until now!" <span class="verse">{2:11}</span> This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana
of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:12}</span> After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
<span class="verse">{2:13}</span> The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem. <span class="verse">{2:14}</span> He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep,
and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <span class="verse">{2:15}</span> He made a whip of
cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen;
and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.
<span class="verse">{2:16}</span> To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of
here! Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!" <span class="verse">{2:17}</span> His disciples
remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:18}</span> The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show us,
seeing that you do these things?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:19}</span> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days
I will raise it up."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:20}</span> The Jews therefore said, "It took forty-six years to build
this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?" <span class="verse">{2:21}</span> But he spoke
of the temple of his body. <span class="verse">{2:22}</span> When therefore he was raised from the
dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the
Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{2:23}</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the
feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.
<span class="verse">{2:24}</span> But Jesus didn't trust himself to them, because he knew
everyone, <span class="verse">{2:25}</span> and because he didn't need for anyone to testify
concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:1}</span> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler
of the Jews. <span class="verse">{3:2}</span> The same came to him by night, and said to him,
"Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do
these signs that you do, unless God is with him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:3}</span> Jesus answered him, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is
born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:4}</span> Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old?
Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:5}</span> Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born
of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God! <span class="verse">{3:6}</span> That
which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit
is spirit. <span class="verse">{3:7}</span> Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born
anew.' <span class="verse">{3:8}</span> The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its
sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is
everyone who is born of the Spirit."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:9}</span> Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:10}</span> Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't
understand these things? <span class="verse">{3:11}</span> Most certainly I tell you, we speak
that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you
don't receive our witness. <span class="verse">{3:12}</span> If I told you earthly things and you
don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
<span class="verse">{3:13}</span> No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of
heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven. <span class="verse">{3:14}</span> As Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
<span class="verse">{3:15}</span> that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal
life. <span class="verse">{3:16}</span> For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only
Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal
life. <span class="verse">{3:17}</span> For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the
world, but that the world should be saved through him. <span class="verse">{3:18}</span> He who
believes in him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged
already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only
Son of God. <span class="verse">{3:19}</span> This is the judgment, that the light has come into
the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their
works were evil. <span class="verse">{3:20}</span> For everyone who does evil hates the light, and
doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. <span class="verse">{3:21}</span> But
he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be
revealed, that they have been done in God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:22}</span> After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the
land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized. <span class="verse">{3:23}</span> John
also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water
there. They came, and were baptized. <span class="verse">{3:24}</span> For John was not yet thrown
into prison. <span class="verse">{3:25}</span> There arose therefore a questioning on the part of
John's disciples with some Jews about purification. <span class="verse">{3:26}</span> They came to
John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan,
to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is
coming to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{3:27}</span> John answered, "A man can receive nothing, unless it has been
given him from heaven. <span class="verse">{3:28}</span> You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am
not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before him.' <span class="verse">{3:29}</span> He who has
the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who
stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's
voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full. <span class="verse">{3:30}</span> He must increase,
but I must decrease. <span class="verse">{3:31}</span> He who comes from above is above all. He
who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He
who comes from heaven is above all. <span class="verse">{3:32}</span> What he has seen and heard,
of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness. <span class="verse">{3:33}</span> He who
has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.
<span class="verse">{3:34}</span> For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives
the Spirit without measure. <span class="verse">{3:35}</span> The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into his hand. <span class="verse">{3:36}</span> One who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won't see life,
but the wrath of God remains on him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:1}</span> Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John <span class="verse">{4:2}</span> (although
Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples), <span class="verse">{4:3}</span> he left Judea,
and departed into Galilee. <span class="verse">{4:4}</span> He needed to pass through Samaria.
<span class="verse">{4:5}</span> So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel
of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <span class="verse">{4:6}</span> Jacob's well was
there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the
well. It was about the sixth hour. <span class="verse">{4:7}</span> A woman of Samaria
came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink." <span class="verse">{4:8}</span> For his
disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:9}</span> The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, "How is it that
you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" (For
Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:10}</span> Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it
is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he
would have given you living water."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:11}</span> The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?
<span class="verse">{4:12}</span> Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well,
and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:13}</span> Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will
thirst again, <span class="verse">{4:14}</span> but whoever drinks of the water that I will give
him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will
become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:15}</span> The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I
don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:16}</span> Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:17}</span> The woman answered, "I have no husband."</p>

<p>Jesus said to her, "You said well, 'I have no husband,' <span class="verse">{4:18}</span> for
you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your
husband. This you have said truly."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:19}</span> The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a
prophet. <span class="verse">{4:20}</span> Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews
say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:21}</span> Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when
neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the
Father. <span class="verse">{4:22}</span> You worship that which you don't know. We worship that
which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. <span class="verse">{4:23}</span> But the hour
comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in
spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.
<span class="verse">{4:24}</span> God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit
and truth."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:25}</span> The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah comes," (he who
is called Christ). "When he has come, he will declare to us all things."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:26}</span> Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who speaks to you."
<span class="verse">{4:27}</span> At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking
with a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do
you speak with her?" <span class="verse">{4:28}</span> So the woman left her water pot, and went
away into the city, and said to the people, <span class="verse">{4:29}</span> "Come, see a man who
told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:30}</span> They went out of the city, and were coming to him. <span class="verse">{4:31}</span> In
the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:32}</span> But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know
about."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:33}</span> The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone
brought him something to eat?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:34}</span> Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who
sent me, and to accomplish his work. <span class="verse">{4:35}</span> Don't you say, 'There are
yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your
eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
<span class="verse">{4:36}</span> He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life;
that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. <span class="verse">{4:37}</span> For
in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.' <span class="verse">{4:38}</span> I
sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have
labored, and you have entered into their labor."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:39}</span> From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because
of the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything that I
did." <span class="verse">{4:40}</span> So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to
stay with them. He stayed there two days. <span class="verse">{4:41}</span> Many more believed
because of his word. <span class="verse">{4:42}</span> They said to the woman, "Now we believe,
not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know
that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:43}</span> After the two days he went out from there and went into
Galilee. <span class="verse">{4:44}</span> For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor
in his own country. <span class="verse">{4:45}</span> So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans
received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at
the feast, for they also went to the feast. <span class="verse">{4:46}</span> Jesus came therefore
again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was
a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <span class="verse">{4:47}</span> When he
heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him,
and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at
the point of death. <span class="verse">{4:48}</span> Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see
signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{4:49}</span> The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child
dies." <span class="verse">{4:50}</span> Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man
believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <span class="verse">{4:51}</span>
As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying
"Your child lives!" <span class="verse">{4:52}</span> So he inquired of them the hour when he
began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the
seventh hour, the fever left him." <span class="verse">{4:53}</span> So the father knew
that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives."
He believed, as did his whole house. <span class="verse">{4:54}</span> This is again the second
sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:1}</span> After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus
went up to Jerusalem. <span class="verse">{5:2}</span> Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there
is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.
<span class="verse">{5:3}</span> In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind,
lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water; <span class="verse">{5:4}</span> for an
angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the
water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was
made whole of whatever disease he had. <span class="verse">{5:5}</span> A certain man was there,
who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <span class="verse">{5:6}</span> When Jesus saw him
lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked
him, "Do you want to be made well?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:7}</span> The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into
the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another
steps down before me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:8}</span> Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:9}</span> Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and
walked.</p>

<p>Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <span class="verse">{5:10}</span> So the Jews said to him
who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry
the mat."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:11}</span> He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me,
'Take up your mat, and walk.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:12}</span> Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take
up your mat, and walk'?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:13}</span> But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had
withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:14}</span> Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
"Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens
to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:15}</span> The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who
had made him well. <span class="verse">{5:16}</span> For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and
sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath. <span class="verse">{5:17}</span>
But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working,
too." <span class="verse">{5:18}</span> For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to
kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God. <span class="verse">{5:19}</span> Jesus therefore
answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he
does, these the Son also does likewise. <span class="verse">{5:20}</span> For the Father has
affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does.
He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel. <span class="verse">{5:21}</span>
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son
also gives life to whom he desires. <span class="verse">{5:22}</span> For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, <span class="verse">{5:23}</span> that all may
honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the
Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:24}</span> "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and
believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into
judgment, but has passed out of death into life. <span class="verse">{5:25}</span> Most certainly,
I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son
of God's voice; and those who hear will live. <span class="verse">{5:26}</span> For as the Father
has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in
himself. <span class="verse">{5:27}</span> He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because
he is a son of man. <span class="verse">{5:28}</span> Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in
which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, <span class="verse">{5:29}</span> and will
come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and
those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. <span class="verse">{5:30}</span> I can
of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous;
because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:31}</span> "If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid. <span class="verse">{5:32}</span>
It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which
he testifies about me is true. <span class="verse">{5:33}</span> You have sent to John, and he has
testified to the truth. <span class="verse">{5:34}</span> But the testimony which I receive is not
from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved. <span class="verse">{5:35}</span> He
was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a
while in his light. <span class="verse">{5:36}</span> But the testimony which I have is greater
than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to
accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
has sent me. <span class="verse">{5:37}</span> The Father himself, who sent me, has testified
about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his
form. <span class="verse">{5:38}</span> You don't have his word living in you; because you don't
believe him whom he sent.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:39}</span> "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them
you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.
<span class="verse">{5:40}</span> Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life. <span class="verse">{5:41}</span> I
don't receive glory from men. <span class="verse">{5:42}</span> But I know you, that you don't
have God's love in yourselves. <span class="verse">{5:43}</span> I have come in my Father's name,
and you don't receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will
receive him. <span class="verse">{5:44}</span> How can you believe, who receive glory from one
another, and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?</p>

<p><span class="verse">{5:45}</span> "Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is
one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope. <span class="verse">{5:46}</span>
For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.
<span class="verse">{5:47}</span> But if you don't believe his writings, how will you believe my
words?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:1}</span> After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the
sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias. <span class="verse">{6:2}</span> A great
multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on
those who were sick. <span class="verse">{6:3}</span> Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat
there with his disciples. <span class="verse">{6:4}</span> Now the Passover, the feast of the
Jews, was at hand. <span class="verse">{6:5}</span> Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and
seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where
are we to buy bread, that these may eat?" <span class="verse">{6:6}</span> This he said to test
him, for he himself knew what he would do.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:7}</span> Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is
not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:8}</span> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to
him, <span class="verse">{6:9}</span> "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two
fish, but what are these among so many?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:10}</span> Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much
grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five
thousand. <span class="verse">{6:11}</span> Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were
sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired. <span class="verse">{6:12}</span>
When they were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken
pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost." <span class="verse">{6:13}</span> So they
gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the
five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten. <span class="verse">{6:14}</span>
When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said,
"This is truly the prophet who comes into the world." <span class="verse">{6:15}</span> Jesus
therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by
force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:16}</span> When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, <span class="verse">{6:17}</span>
and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to
Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. <span class="verse">{6:18}</span> The
sea was tossed by a great wind blowing. <span class="verse">{6:19}</span> When therefore they had
rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus
walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were
afraid. <span class="verse">{6:20}</span> But he said to them, "It is I. Don't be
afraid." <span class="verse">{6:21}</span> They were willing therefore to receive him into the
boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:22}</span> On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in
which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with
his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.
<span class="verse">{6:23}</span> However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they
ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <span class="verse">{6:24}</span> When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples,
they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking
Jesus. <span class="verse">{6:25}</span> When they found him on the other side of the sea, they
asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:26}</span> Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me,
not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were
filled. <span class="verse">{6:27}</span> Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food
which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.
For God the Father has sealed him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:28}</span> They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may
work the works of God?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:29}</span> Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you
believe in him whom he has sent."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:30}</span> They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign,
that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do? <span class="verse">{6:31}</span> Our
fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave
them bread out of heaven to eat.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:32}</span> Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it
wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives
you the true bread out of heaven. <span class="verse">{6:33}</span> For the bread of God is that
which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:34}</span> They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:35}</span> Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to
me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
<span class="verse">{6:36}</span> But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
<span class="verse">{6:37}</span> All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes
to me I will in no way throw out. <span class="verse">{6:38}</span> For I have come down from
heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. <span class="verse">{6:39}</span>
This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to
me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day.
<span class="verse">{6:40}</span> This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees
the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life; and I will
raise him up at the last day."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:41}</span> The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,
"I am the bread which came down out of heaven." <span class="verse">{6:42}</span> They said,
"Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?
How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:43}</span> Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among
yourselves. <span class="verse">{6:44}</span> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me
draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day. <span class="verse">{6:45}</span> It is
written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.'
Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to
me. <span class="verse">{6:46}</span> Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from
God. He has seen the Father. <span class="verse">{6:47}</span> Most certainly, I tell you, he who
believes in me has eternal life. <span class="verse">{6:48}</span> I am the bread of life. <span class="verse">{6:49}</span>
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. <span class="verse">{6:50}</span>
This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat
of it and not die. <span class="verse">{6:51}</span> I am the living bread which came down out of
heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the
bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:52}</span> The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How
can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:53}</span> Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you
don't have life in yourselves. <span class="verse">{6:54}</span> He who eats my flesh and drinks
my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
<span class="verse">{6:55}</span> For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
<span class="verse">{6:56}</span> He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in
him. <span class="verse">{6:57}</span> As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the
Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me. <span class="verse">{6:58}</span>
This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our fathers ate
the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever." <span class="verse">{6:59}</span>
He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:60}</span> Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said,
"This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:61}</span> But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at
this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble? <span class="verse">{6:62}</span> Then what
if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
<span class="verse">{6:63}</span> It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The
words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life. <span class="verse">{6:64}</span> But there
are some of you who don't believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning
who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him.
<span class="verse">{6:65}</span> He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can come
to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:66}</span> At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
with him. <span class="verse">{6:67}</span> Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also
want to go away, do you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:68}</span> Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You
have the words of eternal life. <span class="verse">{6:69}</span> We have come to believe and know
that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{6:70}</span> Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and
one of you is a devil?" <span class="verse">{6:71}</span> Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:1}</span> After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he
wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. <span class="verse">{7:2}</span> Now
the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. <span class="verse">{7:3}</span> His
brothers therefore said to him, "Depart from here, and go into Judea,
that your disciples also may see your works which you do. <span class="verse">{7:4}</span> For no
one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If
you do these things, reveal yourself to the world." <span class="verse">{7:5}</span> For even his
brothers didn't believe in him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:6}</span> Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but
your time is always ready. <span class="verse">{7:7}</span> The world can't hate you, but it hates
me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. <span class="verse">{7:8}</span> You go
up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time
is not yet fulfilled."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:9}</span> Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <span class="verse">{7:10}</span>
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up,
not publicly, but as it were in secret. <span class="verse">{7:11}</span> The Jews therefore
sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?" <span class="verse">{7:12}</span> There was much
murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good
man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray." <span class="verse">{7:13}</span>
Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. <span class="verse">{7:14}</span> But when it
was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and
taught. <span class="verse">{7:15}</span> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man
know letters, having never been educated?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:16}</span> Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but
his who sent me. <span class="verse">{7:17}</span> If anyone desires to do his will, he will know
about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from
myself. <span class="verse">{7:18}</span> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he
who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness
is in him. <span class="verse">{7:19}</span> Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you
keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:20}</span> The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill
you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:21}</span> Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel
because of it. <span class="verse">{7:22}</span> Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is
of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.
<span class="verse">{7:23}</span> If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of
Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man
completely healthy on the Sabbath? <span class="verse">{7:24}</span> Don't judge according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:25}</span> Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this he whom
they seek to kill? <span class="verse">{7:26}</span> Behold, he speaks openly, and they say
nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is
truly the Christ? <span class="verse">{7:27}</span> However we know where this man comes from, but
when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:28}</span> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying,
"You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself,
but he who sent me is true, whom you don't know. <span class="verse">{7:29}</span> I know him,
because I am from him, and he sent me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:30}</span> They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on
him, because his hour had not yet come. <span class="verse">{7:31}</span> But of the multitude,
many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, he won't do
more signs than those which this man has done, will he?" <span class="verse">{7:32}</span> The
Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him,
and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:33}</span> Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer,
then I go to him who sent me. <span class="verse">{7:34}</span> You will seek me, and won't find
me; and where I am, you can't come."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:35}</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this
man go that we won't find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the
Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <span class="verse">{7:36}</span> What is this word that he said,
'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come'?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:37}</span> Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
<span class="verse">{7:38}</span> He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within
him will flow rivers of living water." <span class="verse">{7:39}</span> But he said this about
the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy
Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:40}</span> Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words,
said, "This is truly the prophet." <span class="verse">{7:41}</span> Others said, "This is the
Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
<span class="verse">{7:42}</span> Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of
David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?" <span class="verse">{7:43}</span>
So there arose a division in the multitude because of him. <span class="verse">{7:44}</span> Some
of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. <span class="verse">{7:45}</span>
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and
they said to them, "Why didn't you bring him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:46}</span> The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:47}</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also led
astray, are you? <span class="verse">{7:48}</span> Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of
the Pharisees? <span class="verse">{7:49}</span> But this multitude that doesn't know the law is
accursed."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:50}</span> Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them)
said to them, <span class="verse">{7:51}</span> "Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears
from him personally and knows what he does?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:52}</span> They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and
see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{7:53}</span> Everyone went to his own house, <span class="verse">{8:1}</span> but Jesus went to the
Mount of Olives. <span class="verse">{8:2}</span> Now very early in the morning, he came again
into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down, and
taught them. <span class="verse">{8:3}</span> The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken
in adultery. Having set her in the midst, <span class="verse">{8:4}</span> they told him,
"Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. <span class="verse">{8:5}</span> Now
in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say
about her?" <span class="verse">{8:6}</span> They said this testing him, that they might have
something to accuse him of.</p>

<p>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
<span class="verse">{8:7}</span> But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to
them, "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone
at her." <span class="verse">{8:8}</span> Again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:9}</span> They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience,
went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus
was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. <span class="verse">{8:10}</span>
Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers?
Did no one condemn you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:11}</span> She said, "No one, Lord."</p>

<p>Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin
no more."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:12}</span> Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the
light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in the
darkness, but will have the light of life."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:13}</span> The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about
yourself. Your testimony is not valid."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:14}</span> Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my
testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going;
but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going. <span class="verse">{8:15}</span> You
judge according to the flesh. I judge no one. <span class="verse">{8:16}</span> Even if I do
judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me. <span class="verse">{8:17}</span> It's also written in your law that the
testimony of two people is valid. <span class="verse">{8:18}</span> I am one who testifies
about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:19}</span> They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me,
you would know my Father also." <span class="verse">{8:20}</span> Jesus spoke these words in the
treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because
his hour had not yet come. <span class="verse">{8:21}</span> Jesus said therefore again to them,
"I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins.
Where I go, you can't come."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:22}</span> The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says,
'Where I am going, you can't come?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:23}</span> He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You
are of this world. I am not of this world. <span class="verse">{8:24}</span> I said therefore to
you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I
am he, you will die in your sins."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:25}</span> They said therefore to him, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the
beginning. <span class="verse">{8:26}</span> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning
you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from
him, these I say to the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:27}</span> They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the
Father. <span class="verse">{8:28}</span> Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up
the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of
myself, but as my Father taught me, I say these things. <span class="verse">{8:29}</span> He who
sent me is with me. The Father hasn't left me alone, for I always do
the things that are pleasing to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:30}</span> As he spoke these things, many believed in him. <span class="verse">{8:31}</span> Jesus
therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, "If you remain in my
word, then you are truly my disciples. <span class="verse">{8:32}</span> You will know the truth,
and the truth will make you free."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:33}</span> They answered him, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never
been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:34}</span> Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who
commits sin is the bondservant of sin. <span class="verse">{8:35}</span> A bondservant doesn't
live in the house forever. A son remains forever. <span class="verse">{8:36}</span> If therefore
the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. <span class="verse">{8:37}</span> I know that you
are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no
place in you. <span class="verse">{8:38}</span> I say the things which I have seen with my Father;
and you also do the things which you have seen with your father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:39}</span> They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do
the works of Abraham. <span class="verse">{8:40}</span> But now you seek to kill me, a man who has
told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this.
<span class="verse">{8:41}</span> You do the works of your father."</p>

<p>They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have
one Father, God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:42}</span> Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you
would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't
come of myself, but he sent me. <span class="verse">{8:43}</span> Why don't you understand my
speech? Because you can't hear my word. <span class="verse">{8:44}</span> You are of your father,
the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a
murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because
there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own;
for he is a liar, and its father. <span class="verse">{8:45}</span> But because I tell the truth,
you don't believe me. <span class="verse">{8:46}</span> Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell
the truth, why do you not believe me? <span class="verse">{8:47}</span> He who is of God hears the
words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of
God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:48}</span> Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are a
Samaritan, and have a demon?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:49}</span> Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father,
and you dishonor me. <span class="verse">{8:50}</span> But I don't seek my own glory. There is one
who seeks and judges. <span class="verse">{8:51}</span> Most certainly, I tell you, if a person
keeps my word, he will never see death."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:52}</span> Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a
demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my
word, he will never taste of death.' <span class="verse">{8:53}</span> Are you greater than our
father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself
out to be?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:54}</span> Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It
is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.
<span class="verse">{8:55}</span> You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know
him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.
<span class="verse">{8:56}</span> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was
glad."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:57}</span> The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years
old, and have you seen Abraham?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:58}</span> Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before
Abraham came into existence, I AM."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{8:59}</span> Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was
hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through their midst,
and so passed by.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:1}</span> As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. <span class="verse">{9:2}</span> His
disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that
he was born blind?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:3}</span> Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents;
but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. <span class="verse">{9:4}</span> I must work
the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming,
when no one can work. <span class="verse">{9:5}</span> While I am in the world, I am the light of
the world." <span class="verse">{9:6}</span> When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made
mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud, <span class="verse">{9:7}</span>
and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent").
So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. <span class="verse">{9:8}</span> The neighbors
therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, "Isn't
this he who sat and begged?" <span class="verse">{9:9}</span> Others were saying, "It is he."
Still others were saying, "He looks like him."</p>

<p>He said, "I am he." <span class="verse">{9:10}</span> They therefore were asking him, "How were
your eyes opened?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:11}</span> He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes,
and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away
and washed, and I received sight."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:12}</span> Then they asked him, "Where is he?"</p>

<p>He said, "I don't know."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:13}</span> They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. <span class="verse">{9:14}</span>
It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <span class="verse">{9:15}</span>
Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight.
He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:16}</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from
God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man
who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them. <span class="verse">{9:17}</span>
Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him,
because he opened your eyes?"</p>

<p>He said, "He is a prophet."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:18}</span> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he
had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the
parents of him who had received his sight, <span class="verse">{9:19}</span> and asked them, "Is
this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:20}</span> His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and
that he was born blind; <span class="verse">{9:21}</span> but how he now sees, we don't know; or
who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will
speak for himself." <span class="verse">{9:22}</span> His parents said these things because they
feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would
confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. <span class="verse">{9:23}</span>
Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:24}</span> So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said
to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:25}</span> He therefore answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. One
thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:26}</span> They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he
open your eyes?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:27}</span> He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen.
Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his
disciples, do you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:28}</span> They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are
disciples of Moses. <span class="verse">{9:29}</span> We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as
for this man, we don't know where he comes from."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:30}</span> The man answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where he
comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <span class="verse">{9:31}</span> We know that God doesn't
listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his
will, he listens to him. <span class="verse">{9:32}</span> Since the world began it has never
been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. <span class="verse">{9:33}</span>
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:34}</span> They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do
you teach us?" They threw him out.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:35}</span> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he
said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:36}</span> He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:37}</span> Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who
speaks with you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:38}</span> He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshiped him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:39}</span> Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those
who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:40}</span> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things,
and said to him, "Are we also blind?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{9:41}</span> Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no
sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:1}</span> "Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the
door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber. <span class="verse">{10:2}</span> But one who enters in by the door is the
shepherd of the sheep. <span class="verse">{10:3}</span> The gatekeeper opens the gate for him,
and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and
leads them out. <span class="verse">{10:4}</span> Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes
before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. <span class="verse">{10:5}</span>
They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for
they don't know the voice of strangers." <span class="verse">{10:6}</span> Jesus spoke this
parable to them, but they didn't understand what he was telling them.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:7}</span> Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell
you, I am the sheep's door. <span class="verse">{10:8}</span> All who came before me are thieves
and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them. <span class="verse">{10:9}</span> I am the door.
If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out,
and will find pasture. <span class="verse">{10:10}</span> The thief only comes to steal, kill, and
destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
<span class="verse">{10:11}</span> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his
life for the sheep. <span class="verse">{10:12}</span> He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd,
who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and
flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. <span class="verse">{10:13}</span> The
hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the
sheep. <span class="verse">{10:14}</span> I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by
my own; <span class="verse">{10:15}</span> even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I
lay down my life for the sheep. <span class="verse">{10:16}</span> I have other sheep, which are
not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my
voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. <span class="verse">{10:17}</span> Therefore
the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it
again. <span class="verse">{10:18}</span> No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by
myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
I received this commandment from my Father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:19}</span> Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of
these words. <span class="verse">{10:20}</span> Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane!
Why do you listen to him?" <span class="verse">{10:21}</span> Others said, "These are not the
sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to
open the eyes of the blind, is it?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:22}</span> It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.
<span class="verse">{10:23}</span> It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in
Solomon's porch. <span class="verse">{10:24}</span> The Jews therefore came around him and said to
him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ,
tell us plainly."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:25}</span> Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe. The
works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me. <span class="verse">{10:26}</span>
But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
<span class="verse">{10:27}</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
<span class="verse">{10:28}</span> I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one
will snatch them out of my hand. <span class="verse">{10:29}</span> My Father, who has given them
to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my
Father's hand. <span class="verse">{10:30}</span> I and the Father are one."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:31}</span> Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him. <span class="verse">{10:32}</span>
Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father.
For which of those works do you stone me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:33}</span> The Jews answered him, "We don't stone you for a good work,
but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:34}</span> Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said,
you are gods?' <span class="verse">{10:35}</span> If he called them gods, to whom the word of
God came (and the Scripture can't be broken), <span class="verse">{10:36}</span> do you say of him
whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,'
because I said, 'I am the Son of God?' <span class="verse">{10:37}</span> If I don't do the works
of my Father, don't believe me. <span class="verse">{10:38}</span> But if I do them, though you
don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{10:39}</span> They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their
hand. <span class="verse">{10:40}</span> He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where
John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed. <span class="verse">{10:41}</span> Many came to
him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said
about this man is true." <span class="verse">{10:42}</span> Many believed in him there.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:1}</span> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the
village of Mary and her sister, Martha. <span class="verse">{11:2}</span> It was that Mary who had
anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair,
whose brother, Lazarus, was sick. <span class="verse">{11:3}</span> The sisters therefore sent to
him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick." <span class="verse">{11:4}</span> But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not
to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Son may be glorified by
it." <span class="verse">{11:5}</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <span class="verse">{11:6}</span>
When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the
place where he was. <span class="verse">{11:7}</span> Then after this he said to the disciples,
"Let's go into Judea again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:8}</span> The disciples told him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to
stone you, and are you going there again?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:9}</span> Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a
man walks in the day, he doesn't stumble, because he sees the light of
this world. <span class="verse">{11:10}</span> But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles,
because the light isn't in him." <span class="verse">{11:11}</span> He said these things, and
after that, he said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep,
but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:12}</span> The disciples therefore said, "Lord, if he has fallen
asleep, he will recover."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:13}</span> Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he
spoke of taking rest in sleep. <span class="verse">{11:14}</span> So Jesus said to them plainly
then, "Lazarus is dead. <span class="verse">{11:15}</span> I am glad for your sakes that I was not
there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:16}</span> Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to
his fellow disciples, "Let's go also, that we may die with him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:17}</span> So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb
four days already. <span class="verse">{11:18}</span> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about
fifteen stadia away. <span class="verse">{11:19}</span> Many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
<span class="verse">{11:20}</span> Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met
him, but Mary stayed in the house. <span class="verse">{11:21}</span> Therefore Martha said to
Jesus, "Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have
died. <span class="verse">{11:22}</span> Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will
give you." <span class="verse">{11:23}</span> Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:24}</span> Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the
resurrection at the last day."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:25}</span> Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He
who believes in me will still live, even if he dies. <span class="verse">{11:26}</span> Whoever
lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:27}</span> She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you
are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:28}</span> When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her
sister, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:29}</span> When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.
<span class="verse">{11:30}</span> Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the
place where Martha met him. <span class="verse">{11:31}</span> Then the Jews who were with her in
the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb
to weep there." <span class="verse">{11:32}</span> Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was,
and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you
would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:33}</span> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping
who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, <span class="verse">{11:34}</span>
and said, "Where have you laid him?"</p>

<p>They told him, "Lord, come and see."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:35}</span> Jesus wept.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:36}</span> The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection he had for
him!" <span class="verse">{11:37}</span> Some of them said, "Couldn't this man, who opened the
eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:38}</span> Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the
tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <span class="verse">{11:39}</span> Jesus
said, "Take away the stone."</p>

<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:40}</span> Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed,
you would see God's glory?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:41}</span> So they took away the stone from the place where the
dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I
thank you that you listened to me. <span class="verse">{11:42}</span> I know that you always
listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said
this, that they may believe that you sent me." <span class="verse">{11:43}</span> When he had said
this, he cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:44}</span> He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with
wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:45}</span> Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what
Jesus did, believed in him. <span class="verse">{11:46}</span> But some of them went away to the
Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <span class="verse">{11:47}</span> The
chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said,
"What are we doing? For this man does many signs. <span class="verse">{11:48}</span> If we leave
him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will
come and take away both our place and our nation."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:49}</span> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that
year, said to them, "You know nothing at all, <span class="verse">{11:50}</span> nor do you
consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the
people, and that the whole nation not perish." <span class="verse">{11:51}</span> Now he didn't
say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied
that Jesus would die for the nation, <span class="verse">{11:52}</span> and not for the nation
only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of
God who are scattered abroad. <span class="verse">{11:53}</span> So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death. <span class="verse">{11:54}</span> Jesus therefore
walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the
country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there
with his disciples.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{11:55}</span> Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from
the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
<span class="verse">{11:56}</span> Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they
stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't coming to the
feast at all?" <span class="verse">{11:57}</span> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had
commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that
they might seize him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:1}</span> Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
<span class="verse">{12:2}</span> So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was
one of those who sat at the table with him. <span class="verse">{12:3}</span> Mary, therefore,
took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house
was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <span class="verse">{12:4}</span> Then Judas
Iscariot, Simon's son, one of his disciples, who would betray him,
said, <span class="verse">{12:5}</span> "Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred
denarii, and given to the poor?" <span class="verse">{12:6}</span> Now he said this, not
because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having
the money box, used to steal what was put into it. <span class="verse">{12:7}</span> But Jesus
said, "Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
<span class="verse">{12:8}</span> For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have
me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:9}</span> A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was
there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <span class="verse">{12:10}</span> But the chief
priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, <span class="verse">{12:11}</span> because on
account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:12}</span> On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast.
When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <span class="verse">{12:13}</span> they took
the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried
out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord, the King of Israel!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:14}</span> Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is
written, <span class="verse">{12:15}</span> "Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King
comes, sitting on a donkey's colt." <span class="verse">{12:16}</span> His disciples didn't
understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then
they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they
had done these things to him. <span class="verse">{12:17}</span> The multitude therefore that was
with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from
the dead, was testifying about it. <span class="verse">{12:18}</span> For this cause also the
multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this
sign. <span class="verse">{12:19}</span> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how
you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:20}</span> Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to
worship at the feast. <span class="verse">{12:21}</span> These, therefore, came to Philip, who was
from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we want to see
Jesus." <span class="verse">{12:22}</span> Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came
with Philip, and they told Jesus. <span class="verse">{12:23}</span> Jesus answered them, "The
time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <span class="verse">{12:24}</span> Most
certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and
dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
<span class="verse">{12:25}</span> He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in
this world will keep it to eternal life. <span class="verse">{12:26}</span> If anyone serves me,
let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone
serves me, the Father will honor him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:27}</span> "Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Father, save me
from this time?' But for this cause I came to this time. <span class="verse">{12:28}</span>
Father, glorify your name!"</p>

<p>Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, "I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:29}</span> The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said
that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:30}</span> Jesus answered, "This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for
your sakes. <span class="verse">{12:31}</span> Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince
of this world will be cast out. <span class="verse">{12:32}</span> And I, if I am lifted up from
the earth, will draw all people to myself." <span class="verse">{12:33}</span> But he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he should die. <span class="verse">{12:34}</span> The multitude
answered him, "We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains
forever. How do you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up?' Who is
this Son of Man?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:35}</span> Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light
is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't
overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is
going. <span class="verse">{12:36}</span> While you have the light, believe in the light, that you
may become children of light." Jesus said these things, and he departed
and hid himself from them. <span class="verse">{12:37}</span> But though he had done so many signs
before them, yet they didn't believe in him, <span class="verse">{12:38}</span> that the word of
Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
"Lord, who has believed our report?
   To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:39}</span> For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,
<span class="verse">{12:40}</span> "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart,
   lest they should see with their eyes,
   and perceive with their heart,
   and would turn,
   and I would heal them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:41}</span> Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of
him. <span class="verse">{12:42}</span> Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him,
but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it, so that they
wouldn't be put out of the synagogue, <span class="verse">{12:43}</span> for they loved men's
praise more than God's praise.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{12:44}</span> Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes
not in me, but in him who sent me. <span class="verse">{12:45}</span> He who sees me sees him who
sent me. <span class="verse">{12:46}</span> I have come as a light into the world, that whoever
believes in me may not remain in the darkness. <span class="verse">{12:47}</span> If anyone
listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge him. For I
came not to judge the world, but to save the world. <span class="verse">{12:48}</span> He who
rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The
word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day. <span class="verse">{12:49}</span> For
I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a
commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. <span class="verse">{12:50}</span> I know
that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I
speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:1}</span> Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his
time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father,
having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
<span class="verse">{13:2}</span> During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of
Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, <span class="verse">{13:3}</span> Jesus, knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth
from God, and was going to God, <span class="verse">{13:4}</span> arose from supper, and laid
aside his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around
his waist. <span class="verse">{13:5}</span> Then he poured water into the basin, and began to
wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was
wrapped around him. <span class="verse">{13:6}</span> Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him,
"Lord, do you wash my feet?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:7}</span> Jesus answered him, "You don't know what I am doing now, but
you will understand later."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:8}</span> Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!"</p>

<p>Jesus answered him, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:9}</span> Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my
hands and my head!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:10}</span> Jesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to
have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not
all of you." <span class="verse">{13:11}</span> For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he
said, "You are not all clean." <span class="verse">{13:12}</span> So when he had washed their
feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to
them, "Do you know what I have done to you? <span class="verse">{13:13}</span> You call me,
'Teacher' and 'Lord.' You say so correctly, for so I am. <span class="verse">{13:14}</span> If I
then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought
to wash one another's feet. <span class="verse">{13:15}</span> For I have given you an example,
that you also should do as I have done to you. <span class="verse">{13:16}</span> Most certainly I
tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is
sent greater than he who sent him. <span class="verse">{13:17}</span> If you know these things,
blessed are you if you do them. <span class="verse">{13:18}</span> I don't speak concerning all of
you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be
fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against
me.' <span class="verse">{13:19}</span> From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when
it happens, you may believe that I am he. <span class="verse">{13:20}</span> Most certainly I tell
you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives
me, receives him who sent me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:21}</span> When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:22}</span> The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he
spoke. <span class="verse">{13:23}</span> One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the
table, leaning against Jesus' breast. <span class="verse">{13:24}</span> Simon Peter therefore
beckoned to him, and said to him, "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:25}</span> He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, asked him,
"Lord, who is it?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:26}</span> Jesus therefore answered, "It is he to whom I will give this
piece of bread when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the piece
of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <span class="verse">{13:27}</span> After
the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him.</p>

<p>Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:28}</span> Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him.
<span class="verse">{13:29}</span> For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus
said to him, "Buy what things we need for the feast," or that he should
give something to the poor. <span class="verse">{13:30}</span> Therefore having received that
morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:31}</span> When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has
been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. <span class="verse">{13:32}</span> If God has
been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he
will glorify him immediately. <span class="verse">{13:33}</span> Little children, I will be with
you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews,
'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell you. <span class="verse">{13:34}</span> A new
commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have
loved you; that you also love one another. <span class="verse">{13:35}</span> By this everyone
will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:36}</span> Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you can't follow now, but you
will follow afterwards."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:37}</span> Peter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will
lay down my life for you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{13:38}</span> Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me?
Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied
me three times.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:1}</span> "Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe
also in me. <span class="verse">{14:2}</span> In my Father's house are many homes. If it weren't
so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
<span class="verse">{14:3}</span> If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will
receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also. <span class="verse">{14:4}</span>
Where I go, you know, and you know the way."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:5}</span> Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going.
How can we know the way?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:6}</span> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No
one comes to the Father, except through me. <span class="verse">{14:7}</span> If you had known me,
you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and
have seen him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:8}</span> Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will
be enough for us."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:9}</span> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time,
and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father.
How do you say, 'Show us the Father?' <span class="verse">{14:10}</span> Don't you believe that I
am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I
speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.
<span class="verse">{14:11}</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or
else believe me for the very works' sake. <span class="verse">{14:12}</span> Most certainly I tell
you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and
he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
<span class="verse">{14:13}</span> Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son. <span class="verse">{14:14}</span> If you will ask anything in
my name, I will do it. <span class="verse">{14:15}</span> If you love me, keep my commandments.
<span class="verse">{14:16}</span> I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another
Counselor, that he may be with you forever,--<span class="verse">{14:17}</span> the
Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see him,
neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in
you. <span class="verse">{14:18}</span> I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you. <span class="verse">{14:19}</span>
Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see
me. Because I live, you will live also. <span class="verse">{14:20}</span> In that day you will
know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. <span class="verse">{14:21}</span> One
who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves
me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him,
and will reveal myself to him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:22}</span> Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened
that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{14:23}</span> Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my
word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our
home with him. <span class="verse">{14:24}</span> He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words.
The word which you hear isn't mine, but the Father's who sent me.
<span class="verse">{14:25}</span> I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
<span class="verse">{14:26}</span> But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send
in my name, he will teach you all things, and will remind you of all
that I said to you. <span class="verse">{14:27}</span> Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to
you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don't let your heart be
troubled, neither let it be fearful. <span class="verse">{14:28}</span> You heard how I told you,
'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have
rejoiced, because I said 'I am going to my Father;' for the Father is
greater than I. <span class="verse">{14:29}</span> Now I have told you before it happens so that,
when it happens, you may believe. <span class="verse">{14:30}</span> I will no more speak much
with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.
<span class="verse">{14:31}</span> But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the
Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:1}</span> "I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer. <span class="verse">{15:2}</span>
Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch
that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. <span class="verse">{15:3}</span> You
are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to
you. <span class="verse">{15:4}</span> Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can't bear fruit
by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless
you remain in me. <span class="verse">{15:5}</span> I am the vine. You are the branches. He who
remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from
me you can do nothing. <span class="verse">{15:6}</span> If a man doesn't remain in me, he is
thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw
them into the fire, and they are burned. <span class="verse">{15:7}</span> If you remain in me,
and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it
will be done for you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:8}</span> "In this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit;
and so you will be my disciples. <span class="verse">{15:9}</span> Even as the Father has loved
me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. <span class="verse">{15:10}</span> If you keep my
commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my
Father's commandments, and remain in his love. <span class="verse">{15:11}</span> I have spoken
these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy
may be made full.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:12}</span> "This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as
I have loved you. <span class="verse">{15:13}</span> Greater love has no one than this, that
someone lay down his life for his friends. <span class="verse">{15:14}</span> You are my friends,
if you do whatever I command you. <span class="verse">{15:15}</span> No longer do I call you
servants, for the servant doesn't know what his lord does. But I have
called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have
made known to you. <span class="verse">{15:16}</span> You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and
appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit
should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he
may give it to you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:17}</span> "I command these things to you, that you may love one
another. <span class="verse">{15:18}</span> If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me
before it hated you. <span class="verse">{15:19}</span> If you were of the world, the world would
love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you
out of the world, therefore the world hates you. <span class="verse">{15:20}</span> Remember the
word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than his lord.'
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my
word, they will keep yours also. <span class="verse">{15:21}</span> But all these things will they
do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know him who sent me.
<span class="verse">{15:22}</span> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had
sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. <span class="verse">{15:23}</span> He who hates
me, hates my Father also. <span class="verse">{15:24}</span> If I hadn't done among them the works
which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin. But now have they
seen and also hated both me and my Father. <span class="verse">{15:25}</span> But this happened so
that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They
hated me without a cause.'</p>

<p><span class="verse">{15:26}</span> "When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to
you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father,
he will testify about me. <span class="verse">{15:27}</span> You will also testify, because you
have been with me from the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:1}</span> "These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't be
caused to stumble. <span class="verse">{16:2}</span> They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes,
the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service
to God. <span class="verse">{16:3}</span> They will do these things because they have not
known the Father, nor me. <span class="verse">{16:4}</span> But I have told you these things, so
that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them.
I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with
you. <span class="verse">{16:5}</span> But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks
me, 'Where are you going?' <span class="verse">{16:6}</span> But because I have told you these
things, sorrow has filled your heart. <span class="verse">{16:7}</span> Nevertheless I tell you
the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go
away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to
you. <span class="verse">{16:8}</span> When he has come, he will convict the world about sin,
about righteousness, and about judgment; <span class="verse">{16:9}</span> about sin, because they
don't believe in me; <span class="verse">{16:10}</span> about righteousness, because I am going to
my Father, and you won't see me any more; <span class="verse">{16:11}</span> about judgment,
because the prince of this world has been judged.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:12}</span> "I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them
now. <span class="verse">{16:13}</span> However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will
guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but
whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that
are coming. <span class="verse">{16:14}</span> He will glorify me, for he will take from what is
mine, and will declare it to you. <span class="verse">{16:15}</span> All things whatever the
Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine,
and will declare it to you. <span class="verse">{16:16}</span> A little while, and you will not
see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:17}</span> Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, "What
is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and
again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the
Father?'" <span class="verse">{16:18}</span> They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A
little while?' We don't know what he is saying."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:19}</span> Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and
he said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that
I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little
while, and you will see me?' <span class="verse">{16:20}</span> Most certainly I tell you, that
you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be
sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. <span class="verse">{16:21}</span> A woman,
when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when
she has delivered the child, she doesn't remember the anguish any more,
for the joy that a human being is born into the world. <span class="verse">{16:22}</span>
Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart
will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:23}</span> "In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I
tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give
it to you. <span class="verse">{16:24}</span> Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask,
and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. <span class="verse">{16:25}</span> I have
spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming
when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell
you plainly about the Father. <span class="verse">{16:26}</span> In that day you will ask in my
name; and I don't say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,
<span class="verse">{16:27}</span> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me,
and have believed that I came forth from God. <span class="verse">{16:28}</span> I came out from
the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and
go to the Father."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:29}</span> His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly,
and speak no figures of speech. <span class="verse">{16:30}</span> Now we know that you know all
things, and don't need for anyone to question you. By this we believe
that you came forth from God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{16:31}</span> Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? <span class="verse">{16:32}</span> Behold,
the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered,
everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not
alone, because the Father is with me. <span class="verse">{16:33}</span> I have told you these
things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have
oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{17:1}</span> Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven,
he said, "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son
may also glorify you; <span class="verse">{17:2}</span> even as you gave him authority over all
flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him. <span class="verse">{17:3}</span>
This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and
him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. <span class="verse">{17:4}</span> I glorified you on the earth. I
have accomplished the work which you have given me to do. <span class="verse">{17:5}</span> Now,
Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with
you before the world existed. <span class="verse">{17:6}</span> I revealed your name to the people
whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have
given them to me. They have kept your word. <span class="verse">{17:7}</span> Now they have known
that all things whatever you have given me are from you, <span class="verse">{17:8}</span> for the
words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received
them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have
believed that you sent me. <span class="verse">{17:9}</span> I pray for them. I don't pray for the
world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
<span class="verse">{17:10}</span> All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I
am glorified in them. <span class="verse">{17:11}</span> I am no more in the world, but these are
in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through
your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we
are. <span class="verse">{17:12}</span> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your
name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost,
except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
<span class="verse">{17:13}</span> But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world,
that they may have my joy made full in themselves. <span class="verse">{17:14}</span> I have given
them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world. <span class="verse">{17:15}</span> I pray not that you would
take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil
one. <span class="verse">{17:16}</span> They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
<span class="verse">{17:17}</span> Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth. <span class="verse">{17:18}</span> As
you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
<span class="verse">{17:19}</span> For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also
may be sanctified in truth. <span class="verse">{17:20}</span> Not for these only do I pray, but
for those also who believe in me through their word, <span class="verse">{17:21}</span> that they
may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they
also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.
<span class="verse">{17:22}</span> The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that
they may be one, even as we are one; <span class="verse">{17:23}</span> I in them, and you in me,
that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you
sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me. <span class="verse">{17:24}</span> Father, I desire
that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they
may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the
foundation of the world. <span class="verse">{17:25}</span> Righteous Father, the world hasn't
known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me. <span class="verse">{17:26}</span> I
made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love
with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:1}</span> When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his
disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a garden, into which
he and his disciples entered. <span class="verse">{18:2}</span> Now Judas, who betrayed him, also
knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <span class="verse">{18:3}</span>
Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the
chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and
weapons. <span class="verse">{18:4}</span> Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were
happening to him, went forth, and said to them, "Who are you looking
for?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:5}</span> They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, "I am he."</p>

<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <span class="verse">{18:6}</span> When
therefore he said to them, "I am he," they went backward, and fell to
the ground.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:7}</span> Again therefore he asked them, "Who are you looking for?"</p>

<p>They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:8}</span> Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he. If therefore you
seek me, let these go their way," <span class="verse">{18:9}</span> that the word might be
fulfilled which he spoke, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost
none."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:10}</span> Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck
the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's
name was Malchus. <span class="verse">{18:11}</span> Jesus therefore said to Peter, "Put the sword
into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not
surely drink it?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:12}</span> So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers
of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, <span class="verse">{18:13}</span> and led him to Annas
first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that
year. <span class="verse">{18:14}</span> Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was
expedient that one man should perish for the people. <span class="verse">{18:15}</span> Simon
Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was
known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of
the high priest; <span class="verse">{18:16}</span> but Peter was standing at the door outside. So
the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and
spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. <span class="verse">{18:17}</span> Then the
maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man's
disciples?"</p>

<p>He said, "I am not."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:18}</span> Now the servants and the officers were standing there,
having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming
themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. <span class="verse">{18:19}</span>
The high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about
his teaching. <span class="verse">{18:20}</span> Jesus answered him, "I spoke openly to the world.
I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always
meet. I said nothing in secret. <span class="verse">{18:21}</span> Why do you ask me? Ask those
who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things
which I said."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:22}</span> When he had said this, one of the officers standing by
slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priest
like that?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:23}</span> Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the
evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:24}</span> Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest. <span class="verse">{18:25}</span>
Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore
to him, "You aren't also one of his disciples, are you?"</p>

<p>He denied it, and said, "I am not."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:26}</span> One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of
him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you in the garden
with him?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:27}</span> Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster
crowed.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:28}</span> They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium.
It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium,
that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. <span class="verse">{18:29}</span>
Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you
bring against this man?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:30}</span> They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we
wouldn't have delivered him up to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:31}</span> Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and
judge him according to your law."</p>

<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death," <span class="verse">{18:32}</span> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled,
which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:33}</span> Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called
Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:34}</span> Jesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did
others tell you about me?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:35}</span> Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and
the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:36}</span> Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world. If my
Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I
wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:37}</span> Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"</p>

<p>Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have
been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I
should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my
voice."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:38}</span> Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"</p>

<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to
them, "I find no basis for a charge against him. <span class="verse">{18:39}</span> But you have a
custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore
do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{18:40}</span> Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but
Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:1}</span> So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged him. <span class="verse">{19:2}</span> The
soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and
dressed him in a purple garment. <span class="verse">{19:3}</span> They kept saying, "Hail, King
of the Jews!" and they kept slapping him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:4}</span> Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I
bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a
charge against him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:5}</span> Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the
purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the man!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:6}</span> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him,
they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!"</p>

<p>Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I
find no basis for a charge against him."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:7}</span> The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he
ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:8}</span> When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.
<span class="verse">{19:9}</span> He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where
are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. <span class="verse">{19:10}</span> Pilate therefore
said to him, "Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have
power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:11}</span> Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me,
unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me
to you has greater sin."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:12}</span> At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews
cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's
friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:13}</span> When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus
out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The
Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha." <span class="verse">{19:14}</span> Now it was the
Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He
said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:15}</span> They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"</p>

<p>Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"</p>

<p>The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:16}</span> So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they
took Jesus and led him away. <span class="verse">{19:17}</span> He went out, bearing his cross, to
the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew,
"Golgotha," <span class="verse">{19:18}</span> where they crucified him, and with him two others,
on either side one, and Jesus in the middle. <span class="verse">{19:19}</span> Pilate wrote a
title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." <span class="verse">{19:20}</span> Therefore many of the Jews
read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the
city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <span class="verse">{19:21}</span> The
chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The
King of the Jews,' but, 'he said, I am King of the Jews.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:22}</span> Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:23}</span> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the
coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
<span class="verse">{19:24}</span> Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast
lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, which says,
"They parted my garments among them.
   For my cloak they cast lots."</p>

<p>Therefore the soldiers did these things. <span class="verse">{19:25}</span> But there were
standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,
Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <span class="verse">{19:26}</span> Therefore when
Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he
said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!" <span class="verse">{19:27}</span> Then he said to
the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took
her to his own home.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:28}</span> After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now
finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
<span class="verse">{19:29}</span> Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a
sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth. <span class="verse">{19:30}</span>
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is
finished." He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:31}</span> Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so
that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that
Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away. <span class="verse">{19:32}</span> Therefore the
soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who
was crucified with him; <span class="verse">{19:33}</span> but when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs. <span class="verse">{19:34}</span> However
one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately
blood and water came out. <span class="verse">{19:35}</span> He who has seen has testified, and
his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may
believe. <span class="verse">{19:36}</span> For these things happened, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, "A bone of him will not be broken." <span class="verse">{19:37}</span> Again
another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they pierced."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{19:38}</span> After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple
of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he
might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He came
therefore and took away his body. <span class="verse">{19:39}</span> Nicodemus, who at first came
to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about a hundred Roman pounds. <span class="verse">{19:40}</span> So they took Jesus'
body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of
the Jews is to bury. <span class="verse">{19:41}</span> Now in the place where he was crucified
there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had
ever yet been laid. <span class="verse">{19:42}</span> Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day
(for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:1}</span> Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early,
while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from
the tomb. <span class="verse">{20:2}</span> Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the
other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken
away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid
him!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:3}</span> Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they
went toward the tomb. <span class="verse">{20:4}</span> They both ran together. The other disciple
outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. <span class="verse">{20:5}</span> Stooping and looking
in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn't enter in. <span class="verse">{20:6}</span> Then
Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the
linen cloths lying, <span class="verse">{20:7}</span> and the cloth that had been on his head, not
lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. <span class="verse">{20:8}</span>
So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in,
and he saw and believed. <span class="verse">{20:9}</span> For as yet they didn't know the
Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <span class="verse">{20:10}</span> So the disciples
went away again to their own homes.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:11}</span> But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as
she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb, <span class="verse">{20:12}</span> and she saw two
angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain. <span class="verse">{20:13}</span> They told her, "Woman, why are you
weeping?"</p>

<p>She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't
know where they have laid him." <span class="verse">{20:14}</span> When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:15}</span> Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you
looking for?"</p>

<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you
have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take
him away."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:16}</span> Jesus said to her, "Mary."</p>

<p>She turned and said to him, "Rabboni!" which is to say,
"Teacher!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:17}</span> Jesus said to her, "Don't hold me, for I haven't yet
ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, 'I am
ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:18}</span> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
the Lord, and that he had said these things to her. <span class="verse">{20:19}</span> When
therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and
when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear
of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them,
"Peace be to you."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:20}</span> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his
side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord. <span class="verse">{20:21}</span>
Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Father has
sent me, even so I send you." <span class="verse">{20:22}</span> When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit! <span class="verse">{20:23}</span>
If you forgive anyone's sins, they have been forgiven them. If you
retain anyone's sins, they have been retained."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:24}</span> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with
them when Jesus came. <span class="verse">{20:25}</span> The other disciples therefore said to
him, "We have seen the Lord!"</p>

<p>But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:26}</span> After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas
was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the
midst, and said, "Peace be to you." <span class="verse">{20:27}</span> Then he said to Thomas,
"Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and
put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:28}</span> Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:29}</span> Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have
believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{20:30}</span> Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book; <span class="verse">{20:31}</span> but these are
written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
and that believing you may have life in his name.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:1}</span> After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the
disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself this way. <span class="verse">{21:2}</span>
Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and
the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
<span class="verse">{21:3}</span> Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing."</p>

<p>They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went
out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <span class="verse">{21:4}</span>
But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the
disciples didn't know that it was Jesus. <span class="verse">{21:5}</span> Jesus therefore said to
them, "Children, have you anything to eat?"</p>

<p>They answered him, "No."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:6}</span> He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
and you will find some."</p>

<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish. <span class="verse">{21:7}</span> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It's the Lord!"</p>

<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <span class="verse">{21:8}</span>
But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far
from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging
the net full of fish. <span class="verse">{21:9}</span> So when they got out on the land, they saw
a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. <span class="verse">{21:10}</span> Jesus
said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:11}</span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great
fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the
net wasn't torn.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:12}</span> Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast."</p>

<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing
that it was the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:13}</span> Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the
fish likewise. <span class="verse">{21:14}</span> This is now the third time that Jesus was
revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead. <span class="verse">{21:15}</span> So
when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,
son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?"</p>

<p>He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."</p>

<p>He said to him, "Feed my lambs." <span class="verse">{21:16}</span> He said to him again a
second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"</p>

<p>He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."</p>

<p>He said to him, "Tend my sheep." <span class="verse">{21:17}</span> He said to him the third
time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?"</p>

<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have
affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know
that I have affection for you."</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep. <span class="verse">{21:18}</span> Most certainly I tell
you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you
wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and
another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:19}</span> Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would
glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:20}</span> Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This
was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also
leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to
betray You?" <span class="verse">{21:21}</span> Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about
this man?"</p>

<p><span class="verse">{21:22}</span> Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come,
what is that to you? You follow me." <span class="verse">{21:23}</span> This saying therefore went
out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet
Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that he
stay until I come, what is that to you?" <span class="verse">{21:24}</span> This is the disciple
who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that
his witness is true. <span class="verse">{21:25}</span> There are also many other things which
Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the
world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.</p>
