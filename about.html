<h2>What is Christian Minimalism?</h2>

<blockquote>The disinterest [...] is a disinterest in doing it again, not in it
as it is being done by those who developed the last advanced versions.  <span

<p>The essence of Christianity is attractive and elusive. It <i>is</i>
something. It&rsquo;s not <i>nothing</i>. And, in order to orient myself within
human culture according to it, I need some externalization of it. But
&ldquo;the last advanced versions&rdquo; of Christianity, while good on their
own terms, are too heavy for me to want to &ldquo;do again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christian Minimalism, then, is my attempt to distill an extremely
lightweight Christian structure, so that I can get on with my life. It
specifies three practices for use by me, and any other individual who wishes to
pick them up off the Internet floor.</p>

<p>The <b>first</b> practice is to <u>read the Gospels</u>. XMin doesn&rsquo;t
tell me what <i>not</i> to read. It <i>does</i> tell me what my focal point is,
in coming to terms with human culture: the four Gospels, taken together:
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>

<p>The <b>second</b> practice is to <u>pray without ceasing</u>. XMin
doesn&rsquo;t tell me what <i>not</i> to think. It <i>does</i> tell me to be
attentive, centered, mindful, aware, embodied, fully present in every
moment.</p>

<p>The <b>third</b> practice is the fun part: <u>love one another</u>. XMin
doesn&rsquo;t tell me what <i>not</i> to do. It <i>does</i> hold up Christ, who
washed his disciples' feet like a slave (before being executed by the State).
The Christian Minimalist enjoys attempting the same: engaging all she
meets&mdash;especially face-to-face&mdash;in humble service (consequences be
damned). When she fails, she asks the forgiveness she tries to extend, and
tries again.</p>

<p>That is what Christian Minimalism is.</p> <div
