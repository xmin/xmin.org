<h2>What is Christian Minimalism?</h2>

<blockquote>The disinterest [...] is a disinterest in doing it again, not in it
    as it is being done by those who developed the last advanced versions.

<p>I find the heart of Christianity tantalizing but elusive. I can describe to
you moments when I think I&rsquo;ve glimpsed it, but the news is stale quickly.
Who needs more words to read? And yet it <i>is</i> something. It&rsquo;s not
<i>nothing</i>. And I find it equally stale to pretend that it is for me to
invent anew every moment. I find myself wanting <i>some</i> structure even
while recognizing that no structure is absolute.</p>

<p>Christian Minimalism, then, is my attempt to distill a minimalist form of
Christian structure, so that I can get on with my life. It specifies three
daily practices for use by me, and any other individual who wishes to pick them
up off the Internet floor.</p>

<p>The <b>first</b> practice is to <u>read the Gospels</u>. The age of taboos,
of censorship, is over. XMin doesn&rsquo;t tell me what <i>not</i> to read or
think or do. And yet, there can be a focal point to my view of human culture, a
center. For the Christian Minimalist, this center point is the four Gospels,
taken together: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.</p>

<p>The <b>second</b> practice is to <u>pray with intentions</u>. This is where
I try to align my will, my intentions, with the will of God. This feels to me
to be too intimate to talk about, but I trust that if you&rsquo;re reading
this, then you&rsquo;ll get out of it what you&rsquo;re &ldquo;supposed&rdquo;
to. There, that was an intention, for example. All types of prayer fall under
this heading: meditation, adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication,
intercession, etc. There&rsquo;s no reason for it not to include every
conscious thought I have, in theory. Ok, I&rsquo;m blushing.</p>

<p>The <b>third</b> practice is where the rubber meets the road: <u>love one
    another</u>. The standard is Christ&rsquo;s love for his disciples,
primarily in the washing of their feet (this is in John 13), and ultimately in
the Crucifixion. For me this is very mundane. It means not losing patience with
my children. It means being sensitive to my wife. It means serving my
coworkers.  Reading the Gospels and praying with intentions find their
fulfillment in loving one another. And if you only do this one practice, you
could rightly call yourself a minimalist Christian Minimalist.</p>

<p>So that is where I&rsquo;m coming from with Christian Minimalism. If
